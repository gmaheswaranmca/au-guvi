# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Kruskal's Algorithm

## What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a subset of edges in a connected, undirected, weighted graph that:
- Connects all vertices together
- Has no cycles (forms a tree)
- Has the minimum possible total edge weight

### Key Properties:
- For a graph with `n` vertices, MST has exactly `n-1` edges
- MST is unique if all edge weights are distinct
- Removing any edge from MST disconnects the graph
- Adding any edge to MST creates a cycle

## Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm is a **greedy algorithm** that finds the MST by:
1. Sorting all edges by weight in ascending order
2. Picking the smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle
3. Repeating until we have `n-1` edges

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of weight
2. Initialize each vertex as a separate component (using Union-Find)
3. For each edge in sorted order:
   - If the edge connects two different components, add it to MST
   - Union the two components
4. Stop when MST has `n-1` edges

### Pseudocode:
```
function Kruskal(Graph G):
    MST = empty set
    Sort all edges by weight
    Initialize Union-Find data structure
    
    for each edge (u, v) in sorted order:
        if Find(u) != Find(v):
            Add edge (u, v) to MST
            Union(u, v)
    
    return MST
```

## Union-Find Data Structure

Kruskal's algorithm uses **Union-Find** (Disjoint Set Union) to efficiently:
- Check if two vertices are in the same component
- Merge two components

### Operations:
- **Find(x)**: Returns the root/representative of the set containing x
- **Union(x, y)**: Merges the sets containing x and y

### Implementation with Path Compression and Union by Rank:
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        
        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True
```

## Complete Implementation

```python
def kruskal_mst(n, edges):
    """
    Find MST using Kruskal's algorithm
    
    Args:
        n: number of vertices (0 to n-1)
        edges: list of (weight, u, v) tuples
    
    Returns:
        List of edges in MST and total weight
    """
    # Sort edges by weight
    edges.sort()
    
    # Initialize Union-Find
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    mst_edges = []
    total_weight = 0
    
    for weight, u, v in edges:
        if uf.union(u, v):
            mst_edges.append((u, v, weight))
            total_weight += weight
            
            # Stop when we have n-1 edges
            if len(mst_edges) == n - 1:
                break
    
    return mst_edges, total_weight

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Graph with 4 vertices (0, 1, 2, 3)
    n = 4
    edges = [
        (1, 0, 1),  # weight=1, edge 0-1
        (2, 1, 2),  # weight=2, edge 1-2
        (3, 2, 3),  # weight=3, edge 2-3
        (4, 0, 2),  # weight=4, edge 0-2
        (5, 1, 3),  # weight=5, edge 1-3
        (6, 0, 3),  # weight=6, edge 0-3
    ]
    
    mst, weight = kruskal_mst(n, edges)
    print(f"MST edges: {mst}")
    print(f"Total weight: {weight}")
```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting edges**: O(E log E)
- **Union-Find operations**: O(E α(V)) where α is inverse Ackermann function
- **Overall**: O(E log E) where E = number of edges

### Space Complexity:
- **Union-Find structure**: O(V)
- **Edge storage**: O(E)
- **Overall**: O(V + E)

## Example Walkthrough

Consider this graph:
```
    0 ---- 1
    |    / |
    |   /  |
    |  /   |
    | /    |
    2 ---- 3
```

Edges with weights:
- (0,1): weight 1
- (1,2): weight 2
- (2,3): weight 3
- (0,2): weight 4
- (1,3): weight 5
- (0,3): weight 6

### Step-by-step execution:
1. **Sort edges**: [(1,0,1), (2,1,2), (3,2,3), (4,0,2), (5,1,3), (6,0,3)]
2. **Process (0,1), weight=1**: Different components → Add to MST
3. **Process (1,2), weight=2**: Different components → Add to MST
4. **Process (2,3), weight=3**: Different components → Add to MST
5. **Process (0,2), weight=4**: Same component → Skip
6. **Done**: MST has 3 edges (n-1 = 4-1 = 3)

**Result**: MST = {(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)}, Total weight = 6
