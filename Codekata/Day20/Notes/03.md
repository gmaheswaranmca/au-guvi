# Network Flow

## Introduction

**Network Flow** is a fundamental concept in graph theory and optimization that models the movement of resources through a network. It's used to solve problems involving the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source to a sink in a flow network.

## Key Concepts

### Flow Network
A **flow network** is a directed graph where:
- Each edge has a **capacity** (maximum flow it can carry)
- There's a **source** vertex (s) where flow originates
- There's a **sink** vertex (t) where flow terminates
- Flow conservation: Flow in = Flow out (except at source and sink)

### Definitions

1. **Capacity**: `c(u,v)` - maximum flow that can pass through edge (u,v)
2. **Flow**: `f(u,v)` - actual flow through edge (u,v)
3. **Residual Capacity**: `c_f(u,v) = c(u,v) - f(u,v)` - remaining capacity
4. **Residual Graph**: Graph with residual capacities as edge weights

### Flow Properties

1. **Capacity Constraint**: `0 ≤ f(u,v) ≤ c(u,v)` for all edges (u,v)
2. **Flow Conservation**: For all vertices v (except s and t):
   ```
   Σ f(u,v) = Σ f(v,w)
   (incoming flow = outgoing flow)
   ```
3. **Skew Symmetry**: `f(u,v) = -f(v,u)`

## Maximum Flow Problem

**Goal**: Find the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from source s to sink t.

### Applications:
- Transportation networks
- Communication networks
- Bipartite matching
- Project scheduling
- Image segmentation

## Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

The **Ford-Fulkerson method** is a greedy algorithm that finds maximum flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize flow to 0
2. While there exists an augmenting path from s to t:
   - Find the path and its bottleneck capacity
   - Augment flow along the path
   - Update residual graph
3. Return maximum flow

### Pseudocode:
```
function FordFulkerson(Graph G, source s, sink t):
    max_flow = 0
    
    while there exists path P from s to t in residual graph:
        bottleneck = min capacity along path P
        max_flow += bottleneck
        
        for each edge (u,v) in path P:
            if (u,v) is forward edge:
                increase flow on (u,v) by bottleneck
            else:
                decrease flow on (v,u) by bottleneck
    
    return max_flow
```

## Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

**Edmonds-Karp** is a specific implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that uses **BFS** to find augmenting paths.

### Implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

def edmonds_karp(graph, source, sink):
    """
    Find maximum flow using Edmonds-Karp algorithm
    
    Args:
        graph: adjacency matrix where graph[u][v] is capacity from u to v
        source: source vertex
        sink: sink vertex
    
    Returns:
        Maximum flow value
    """
    n = len(graph)
    max_flow = 0
    
    # Create residual graph
    residual = [[graph[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    
    def bfs_find_path():
        """Find augmenting path using BFS"""
        visited = [False] * n
        parent = [-1] * n
        queue = deque([source])
        visited[source] = True
        
        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()
            
            for v in range(n):
                if not visited[v] and residual[u][v] > 0:
                    visited[v] = True
                    parent[v] = u
                    queue.append(v)
                    
                    if v == sink:
                        return parent
        
        return None
    
    # Find augmenting paths and update flow
    while True:
        parent = bfs_find_path()
        if parent is None:
            break
        
        # Find bottleneck capacity
        path_flow = float('inf')
        s = sink
        while s != source:
            path_flow = min(path_flow, residual[parent[s]][s])
            s = parent[s]
        
        # Update residual capacities
        max_flow += path_flow
        v = sink
        while v != source:
            u = parent[v]
            residual[u][v] -= path_flow
            residual[v][u] += path_flow
            v = parent[v]
    
    return max_flow
```

## Dinic's Algorithm

**Dinic's algorithm** is more efficient, using **level graphs** and **blocking flows**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Level Graph**: BFS tree from source with shortest distances
- **Blocking Flow**: Flow where every path from s to t has at least one saturated edge

### Implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

class Dinic:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, cap):
        """Add edge with capacity"""
        self.graph[u].append([v, cap, len(self.graph[v])])
        self.graph[v].append([u, 0, len(self.graph[u]) - 1])
    
    def bfs(self, s, t):
        """Build level graph using BFS"""
        level = [-1] * self.n
        level[s] = 0
        queue = deque([s])
        
        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()
            for v, cap, _ in self.graph[u]:
                if level[v] < 0 and cap > 0:
                    level[v] = level[u] + 1
                    queue.append(v)
        
        return level[t] >= 0, level
    
    def dfs(self, u, t, flow, level, iter):
        """Find blocking flow using DFS"""
        if u == t:
            return flow
        
        while iter[u] < len(self.graph[u]):
            v, cap, rev = self.graph[u][iter[u]]
            
            if level[v] == level[u] + 1 and cap > 0:
                min_flow = min(flow, cap)
                result = self.dfs(v, t, min_flow, level, iter)
                
                if result > 0:
                    self.graph[u][iter[u]][1] -= result
                    self.graph[v][rev][1] += result
                    return result
            
            iter[u] += 1
        
        return 0
    
    def max_flow(self, s, t):
        """Find maximum flow from s to t"""
        flow = 0
        
        while True:
            reachable, level = self.bfs(s, t)
            if not reachable:
                break
            
            iter = [0] * self.n
            while True:
                pushed = self.dfs(s, t, float('inf'), level, iter)
                if pushed == 0:
                    break
                flow += pushed
        
        return flow
```

## Push-Relabel Algorithm

**Push-Relabel** is another efficient algorithm using **preflow** and **height functions**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Preflow**: Flow that may exceed conservation at some vertices
- **Height Function**: Assigns heights to vertices to guide flow
- **Push Operation**: Send flow from active vertex to lower neighbor
- **Relabel Operation**: Increase height of active vertex

### Basic Implementation:
```python
def push_relabel(graph, source, sink):
    """
    Maximum flow using Push-Relabel algorithm
    
    Args:
        graph: adjacency matrix
        source: source vertex
        sink: sink vertex
    
    Returns:
        Maximum flow value
    """
    n = len(graph)
    
    # Initialize
    height = [0] * n
    excess = [0] * n
    residual = [[graph[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initial preflow
    height[source] = n
    for v in range(n):
        if residual[source][v] > 0:
            excess[v] = residual[source][v]
            excess[source] -= residual[source][v]
            residual[v][source] = residual[source][v]
            residual[source][v] = 0
    
    def push(u, v):
        """Push flow from u to v"""
        flow = min(excess[u], residual[u][v])
        excess[u] -= flow
        excess[v] += flow
        residual[u][v] -= flow
        residual[v][u] += flow
    
    def relabel(u):
        """Increase height of vertex u"""
        min_height = float('inf')
        for v in range(n):
            if residual[u][v] > 0:
                min_height = min(min_height, height[v])
        height[u] = min_height + 1
    
    # Main loop
    while True:
        # Find active vertex (excess > 0, not source or sink)
        active = -1
        for u in range(n):
            if u != source and u != sink and excess[u] > 0:
                active = u
                break
        
        if active == -1:
            break
        
        # Try to push
        pushed = False
        for v in range(n):
            if residual[active][v] > 0 and height[active] == height[v] + 1:
                push(active, v)
                pushed = True
                break
        
        # If no push possible, relabel
        if not pushed:
            relabel(active)
    
    return excess[sink]
```

|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Ford-Fulkerson | O(E × max_flow) | O(V²) |
| Edmonds-Karp | O(VE²) | O(V²) |

| Push-Relabel | O(V²E) | O(V²) |

## Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem

**Theorem**: In any flow network, the maximum flow equals the minimum cut.

### Cut Definition:
A **cut** (S, T) is a partition of vertices where s ∈ S and t ∈ T.
- **Cut capacity**: Sum of capacities of edges from S to T
- **Min-cut**: Cut with minimum capacity

### Finding Min-Cut:
After finding max-flow, vertices reachable from source in residual graph form S.

```python
def find_min_cut(graph, source, sink, max_flow_result):
    """Find minimum cut after computing maximum flow"""
    n = len(graph)
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def dfs(u, residual):
        visited[u] = True
        for v in range(n):
            if not visited[v] and residual[u][v] > 0:
                dfs(v, residual)
    
    # Run DFS from source in residual graph
    dfs(source, max_flow_result['residual'])
    
    # Find cut edges
    cut_edges = []
    for u in range(n):
        for v in range(n):
            if visited[u] and not visited[v] and graph[u][v] > 0:
                cut_edges.append((u, v))
    
    return cut_edges
```

    """Convert bipartite matching to max flow"""

    # Build flow network
    graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Source to left vertices
    for i in range(len(left)):
        graph[source][i + 1] = 1
    
    # Right vertices to sink
    for i in range(len(right)):
        graph[len(left) + i + 1][sink] = 1
    
    # Bipartite edges
    for u, v in edges:
