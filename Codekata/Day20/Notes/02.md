# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Prim's Algorithm

## Overview

**Prim's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by growing the tree one vertex at a time. It starts from an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

## Key Concepts

### Approach:
- **Vertex-based**: Grows MST by adding one vertex at a time
- **Cut Property**: At each step, finds the minimum weight edge crossing the cut
- **Greedy Choice**: Always selects the cheapest edge to expand the tree

### Cut Property:
For any cut (S, V-S) in a graph, the minimum weight edge crossing the cut is safe for MST.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Start with any vertex as the initial MST
2. **Maintain**: Keep track of vertices in MST and those not in MST
3. **Select**: Choose the minimum weight edge connecting MST to non-MST vertices
4. **Add**: Add the selected edge and vertex to MST
5. **Repeat**: Continue until all vertices are included

### Pseudocode:
```
function Prim(Graph G, start_vertex):
    MST = empty set
    visited = {start_vertex}
    edges = priority queue of all edges from start_vertex
    
    while visited.size < G.vertices.size:
        edge = edges.extractMin()
        u, v, weight = edge
        
        if v not in visited:
            Add edge (u, v) to MST
            Add v to visited
            Add all edges from v to unvisited vertices to edges
    
    return MST
```

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Using Priority Queue (Heap)

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def prim_mst_heap(graph, start=0):
    """
    Prim's MST using priority queue
    
    Args:
        graph: adjacency list {vertex: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}
        start: starting vertex
    
    Returns:
        List of MST edges and total weight
    """
    n = len(graph)
    visited = set()
    mst_edges = []
    total_weight = 0
    
    # Priority queue: (weight, vertex, parent)
    pq = [(0, start, -1)]
    
    while pq and len(visited) < n:
        weight, u, parent = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if u in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add(u)
        if parent != -1:
            mst_edges.append((parent, u, weight))
            total_weight += weight
        
        # Add all adjacent edges to priority queue
        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[u]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (edge_weight, neighbor, u))
    
    return mst_edges, total_weight
```

### 2. Using Key Array (More Efficient)

```python
def prim_mst_key_array(graph, start=0):
    """
    Prim's MST using key array approach
    
    Args:
        graph: adjacency list {vertex: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}
        start: starting vertex
    
    Returns:
        List of MST edges and total weight
    """
    n = len(graph)
    
    # Key values used to pick minimum weight edge
    key = [float('inf')] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    in_mst = [False] * n
    
    # Start with first vertex
    key[start] = 0
    mst_edges = []
    total_weight = 0
    
    for _ in range(n):
        # Find minimum key vertex not yet in MST
        min_key = float('inf')
        u = -1
        for v in range(n):
            if not in_mst[v] and key[v] < min_key:
                min_key = key[v]
                u = v
        
        if u == -1:
            break
            
        in_mst[u] = True
        
        if parent[u] != -1:
            mst_edges.append((parent[u], u, key[u]))
            total_weight += key[u]
        
        # Update key values of adjacent vertices
        for neighbor, weight in graph[u]:
            if not in_mst[neighbor] and weight < key[neighbor]:
                key[neighbor] = weight
                parent[neighbor] = u
    
    return mst_edges, total_weight
```

### 3. Optimized with Min-Heap and Decrease Key

```python
import heapq

class PrimMST:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = graph
        self.n = len(graph)
    
    def find_mst(self, start=0):
        """
        Optimized Prim's algorithm with decrease key operation
        """
        # Initialize distances and parent tracking
        key = [float('inf')] * self.n
        parent = [-1] * self.n
        in_mst = [False] * self.n
        
        # Priority queue: (key_value, vertex)
        pq = [(0, start)]
        key[start] = 0
        
        mst_edges = []
        total_weight = 0
        
        while pq:
            current_key, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            if in_mst[u]:
                continue
                
            in_mst[u] = True
            
            if parent[u] != -1:
                mst_edges.append((parent[u], u, current_key))
                total_weight += current_key
            
            # Process all adjacent vertices
            for neighbor, weight in self.graph[u]:
                if not in_mst[neighbor] and weight < key[neighbor]:
                    key[neighbor] = weight
                    parent[neighbor] = u
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (weight, neighbor))
        
        return mst_edges, total_weight
```

## Complete Example

```python
def create_graph():
    """Create sample graph for demonstration"""
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Add edges (undirected graph)
    edges = [
        (0, 1, 2), (0, 3, 6),
        (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 5),
        (2, 4, 7),
        (3, 4, 9)
    ]
    
    for u, v, w in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
    
    return graph

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = create_graph()
    
    print("Graph representation:")
    for vertex, edges in graph.items():
        print(f"Vertex {vertex}: {edges}")
    
    # Using heap-based approach
    mst_edges, total_weight = prim_mst_heap(graph, start=0)
    
    print(f"\nMST using Prim's algorithm:")
    print(f"Edges: {mst_edges}")
    print(f"Total weight: {total_weight}")
```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
| Implementation | Time Complexity | Best for |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Simple (Key Array) | O(V²) | Dense graphs |
| Binary Heap | O(E log V) | Sparse graphs |
| Fibonacci Heap | O(E + V log V) | Theoretical optimum |

### Space Complexity:
- **All implementations**: O(V + E)
- **Additional space**: O(V) for tracking visited vertices and keys

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider this graph:
```
    0 ---- 1 ---- 2
    |    / |    /
    |   /  |   /
    |  /   |  /
    | /    | /
    3 ---- 4
```

Edge weights:
- (0,1): 2, (0,3): 6
- (1,2): 3, (1,3): 8, (1,4): 5  
- (2,4): 7
- (3,4): 9

### Execution starting from vertex 0:

1. **Start**: MST = {0}, Candidates = {(0,1,2), (0,3,6)}
2. **Step 1**: Add edge (0,1,2), MST = {0,1}
   - New candidates: (1,2,3), (1,3,8), (1,4,5)
3. **Step 2**: Add edge (1,2,3), MST = {0,1,2}
   - New candidates: (2,4,7)
4. **Step 3**: Add edge (1,4,5), MST = {0,1,2,4}
   - Remove (2,4,7) as both vertices are in MST
5. **Step 4**: Add edge (0,3,6), MST = {0,1,2,3,4}

**Result**: MST = {(0,1,2), (1,2,3), (1,4,5), (0,3,6)}, Total weight = 16
