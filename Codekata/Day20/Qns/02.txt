Problem Title:
Minimum Cost to Connect Cities

Problem Description:
You are given N cities numbered from 1 to N and a list of M possible connections between pairs of cities. Each connection has a cost associated with it. Your task is to find the minimum total cost required to connect all the cities such that there is a path between any two cities (i.e., the network is connected). If it is not possible to connect all the cities, output -1.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and M, the number of cities and the number of possible connections.
- The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, and w, denoting a connection between city u and city v with cost w.

Output Format:
- Output a single integer, the minimum total cost to connect all the cities, or -1 if it is not possible.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6

Sample Input:
4 5
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 4 5
1 4 2
2 4 1

Sample Output:
6

Explanation:
The minimum spanning tree connects the cities as follows: 2-4 (1), 1-4 (2), 2-3 (4). Total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
