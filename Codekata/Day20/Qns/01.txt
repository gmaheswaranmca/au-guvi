Problem Title:
Minimum Spanning Tree Construction

Problem Description:
Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph with N nodes and M edges, your task is to implement Kruskal’s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. Output the total weight of the MST.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and M, the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
- The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, and w, representing an edge between nodes u and v with weight w.

Output Format:
- Output a single integer, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- N - 1 ≤ M ≤ 2 × 10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9
- The graph is connected.
- There are no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

Sample Input:
4 5
1 2 1
1 3 4
2 3 2
2 4 3
3 4 5

Sample Output:
6

Explanation:
The minimum spanning tree includes the edges (1-2), (2-3), and (2-4) with weights 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The total weight is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
