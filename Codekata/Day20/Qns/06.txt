Problem Title:
Minimum Cost to Connect Cities

Problem Description:
You are given a list of N cities, numbered from 1 to N. There are M possible roads, each connecting two different cities with a certain cost. Your task is to find the minimum total cost required to connect all the cities such that there is a path between any pair of cities (i.e., the network is connected). If it is not possible to connect all the cities, output -1.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers N and M, the number of cities and the number of possible roads.
The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, and w, denoting that there is a road between city u and city v with cost w.

Output Format:
Print a single integer, the minimum total cost to connect all the cities. If it is not possible, print -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6

Sample Input 1:
4 5
1 2 3
1 3 4
4 2 6
3 4 5
1 4 10

Sample Output 1:
12

Sample Explanation 1:
The minimum cost to connect all cities is 12, using the roads (1-2), (1-3), and (3-4).

Sample Input 2:
3 1
1 2 5

Sample Output 2:
-1

Sample Explanation 2:
City 3 cannot be connected to the network.
