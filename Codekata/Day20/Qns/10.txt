Problem Title:
Critical Connections in a Network

Problem Description:
You are given a network of n servers labeled from 0 to n-1. The network is connected by a list of connections, where each connection is a pair of servers [u, v] representing a bidirectional connection between server u and server v. A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some others (i.e., the network becomes disconnected). Your task is to find all such critical connections in the network.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers n and m, the number of servers and the number of connections.
- The next m lines each contain two integers u and v, representing a connection between servers u and v.

Output Format:
- Output all critical connections as a list of pairs [u, v]. Each pair should be printed on a separate line, with u and v separated by a space. The order of the pairs does not matter.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= m <= 2*10^5
- 0 <= u, v < n
- There are no duplicate connections.
- The network is connected.

Sample Input:
4 4
0 1
1 2
2 0
1 3

Sample Output:
1 3

Explanation:
Removing the connection [1, 3] disconnects server 3 from the rest of the network. The other connections are not critical because their removal does not disconnect the network.

Difficulty:
Medium
