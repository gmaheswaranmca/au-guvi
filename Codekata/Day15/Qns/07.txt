Problem Title: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Problem Description:
You are given N items, each with a weight and a value. You have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity W. Your task is to determine the maximum total value of items that can be put into the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or don't pick it (0/1 property).

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and W, the number of items and the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
- The second line contains N integers, the values of the items.
- The third line contains N integers, the weights of the items.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the maximum value that can be put in the knapsack.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ W ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ value[i], weight[i] ≤ 1000

Sample Input:
4 8
10 40 50 70
1 3 4 5

Sample Output:
110

Explanation:
Pick items with values 40 and 70 (weights 3 and 5), total weight is 8 and total value is 110.
