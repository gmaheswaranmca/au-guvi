Problem Title:
Min Cost Climbing Stairs

Problem Description:
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of step i on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You can start from step 0 or step 1. Your goal is to reach the top of the staircase (beyond the last index) with the minimum total cost.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of stairs.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, the cost of each stair.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

Sample Input:
6
10 15 20 5 10 5

Sample Output:
20

Explanation:
You can start at step 1 (cost 15), then step to 3 (cost 5), then to 5 (cost 5), and finally reach the top. Total cost = 15 + 5 + 5 = 25. But a cheaper way is: step 0 (10), step 2 (20), step 4 (10), total cost = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40. The minimum is 20 by taking steps 1 -> 3 -> 5.

"You can start at step 1 (cost 15), then step to 3 (cost 5), then jump directly to the top. Total cost = 15 + 5 = 20. This is cheaper than other paths like 0→2→4→top (cost 40) or 1→3→5→top (cost 25)."
