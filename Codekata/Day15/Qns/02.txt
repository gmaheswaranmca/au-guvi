Problem Title: Fibonacci Number

Problem Description:
Given an integer n, compute the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

Write a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

Input Format:
A single integer n.

Output Format:
A single integer representing the nth Fibonacci number.

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 40
