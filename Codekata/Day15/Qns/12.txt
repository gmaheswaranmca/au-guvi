Problem Title: Activity Selection Problem

Problem Description:
Given N activities with their start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. Two activities are said to be non-overlapping if the start time of one activity is not less than the end time of the other.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a single integer N, the number of activities.
- The next N lines each contain two integers, S and E, representing the start and end times of each activity.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ S < E ≤ 10^9

Sample Input:
