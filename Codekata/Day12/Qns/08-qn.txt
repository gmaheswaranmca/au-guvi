Problem Title:
Number of Islands

Problem Description:
Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers, m and n, representing the number of rows and columns of the grid.
- The next m lines each contain a string of length n, consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the grid.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the number of islands in the grid.

Constraints:
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is either '0' or '1'

Sample Input:
4 5
11000
11000
00100
00011

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
There are three islands:
- The first island is formed by the group of '1's at the top left.
- The second island is the single '1' in the middle.
- The third island is the two '1's at the bottom right.
