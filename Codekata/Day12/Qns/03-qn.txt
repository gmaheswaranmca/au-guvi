Problem Title: Cycle Detection in Directed Graph

Problem Description:
Given a directed graph with N nodes and M edges, determine whether the graph contains at least one cycle. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, following the direction of the edges. Your task is to detect if such a cycle exists in the given graph.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and M, the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph.
- The next M lines each contain two integers u and v, representing a directed edge from node u to node v.

Output Format:
- Print "Yes" if the graph contains a cycle, otherwise print "No".

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ M ≤ 2×10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N

Sample Output 1:
Yes

Explanation 1:
There is a cycle: 2 → 3 → 4 → 2.

Sample Input 2:
3 2
1 2
2 3

Sample Output 2:
No

Explanation 2:
There is no cycle in the graph.
