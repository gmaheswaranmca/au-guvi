Problem Title:
Word Ladder

Problem Description:
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary's word list, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
3. Return 0 if no such sequence exists.

Input Format:
- The first line contains the beginWord.
- The second line contains the endWord.
- The third line contains an integer n, the number of words in the word list.
- The next n lines each contain a word from the word list.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer: the length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Constraints:
- 1 <= beginWord.length == endWord.length <= 10
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- All words consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord, endWord, and each word in the word list are of the same length.

Sample Input:
hit
cog
6
hot
dot
dog
lot
log
cog

Sample Output:
5

Explanation:
The shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which has 5 words.

Difficulty:
