Problem Title:
Connected Components Count

Problem Description:
Given an undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of edges, count the number of connected components in the graph. Two nodes are in the same connected component if there is a path between them (directly or indirectly).

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers n and m, the number of nodes and the number of edges.
- The next m lines each contain two integers u and v, representing an undirected edge between nodes u and v.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the number of connected components in the graph.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^5
- 0 <= u, v < n

Sample Input:
5 3
0 1
1 2
3 4

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
There are two connected components: {0,1,2} and {3,4}.
