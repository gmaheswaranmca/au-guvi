-  A graph is a non-linear data structure 
   made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). 
   It is used to represent networks 
   like social connections, maps, the internet, 
   dependency structures, and more.
    ðŸ”¹ Types of Graphs:
        * Directed vs Undirected: Edges have direction or not.
        * Weighted vs Unweighted: Edges may carry weights (e.g., distances, costs).
        * Cyclic vs Acyclic: May or may not contain cycles.
        * Connected vs Disconnected: Whether all nodes are reachable from each other.
        * Simple vs Multigraph: No multiple edges between the same pair vs allowing them.

    ðŸ”¹ Representation:
        * Adjacency Matrix: 2D array showing connections.
        * Adjacency List: List of nodes with their neighbors (space-efficient).

    ðŸ”¹ Applications:
        * Shortest path finding (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
        * Topological sort (DAG)
        * Network routing
        * Cycle detection
        * Social network analysis
        * Game AI and puzzles
