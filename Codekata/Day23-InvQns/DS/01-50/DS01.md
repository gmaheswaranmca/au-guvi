**Level:** Beginner

**FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS**

**1. What is a data structure? (Google, Amazon)**
Answer: A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It defines the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them. Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

Key characteristics:
- Organization of data in memory
- Efficient access and modification operations
- Defines relationships between data elements
- Supports various operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting

**2. What is the difference between linear and non-linear data structures? (Microsoft, Zoho)**
Answer: 
**Linear Data Structures:**
- Elements are arranged in a sequential manner
- Each element has a unique predecessor and successor (except first and last)
- Elements are accessed in a linear order
- Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Memory utilization is not efficient
- Implementation is easier

**Non-Linear Data Structures:**
- Elements are not arranged in sequential manner
- Elements can have multiple predecessors and successors
- Elements are accessed in a hierarchical manner
- Examples: Trees, Graphs, Heaps
- Memory utilization is efficient
- Implementation is more complex

**3. What is the difference between static and dynamic data structures? (Facebook, Google)**
Answer:
**Static Data Structures:**
- Fixed size allocated at compile time
- Memory allocation cannot be changed during runtime
- Memory is allocated on the stack
- Examples: Arrays, Structures
- Faster access due to fixed memory location
- Memory wastage if not fully utilized
- Less flexible

**Dynamic Data Structures:**
- Size can be changed during runtime
- Memory allocation happens at runtime
- Memory is allocated on the heap
- Examples: Linked Lists, Dynamic Arrays, Trees
- Slower access due to pointer dereferencing
- Efficient memory utilization
- More flexible and scalable

**4. What are primitive and non-primitive data structures? (Amazon, Microsoft)**
Answer:
**Primitive Data Structures:**
- Basic data types provided by programming language
- Cannot be decomposed into simpler data types
- Directly operated by machine instructions
- Examples: int, float, char, boolean, double
- Fixed size and format
- Stored in stack memory

**Non-Primitive Data Structures:**
- Derived from primitive data types
- Can be decomposed into primitive data types
- More complex and sophisticated
- Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- Variable size (in dynamic structures)
- Can be stored in stack or heap memory
- Also called composite or aggregate data types

**5. What is time complexity and space complexity? (Zoho, Facebook)**
Answer:
**Time Complexity:**
- Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete
- Expressed as a function of input size (n)
- Represents the number of operations performed
- Common notations: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²)
- Helps compare efficiency of different algorithms
- Independent of hardware and programming language

**Space Complexity:**
- Measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses
- Includes both auxiliary space and input space
- Expressed as a function of input size (n)
- Auxiliary space: Extra space used by algorithm
- Input space: Space required to store input data
- Important for memory-constrained environments

**ARRAYS**

**6. What is an array? (Google, Amazon)**
Answer: An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed using an index or subscript.

Key characteristics:
- **Homogeneous**: All elements are of the same data type
- **Fixed size**: Size is determined at declaration time
- **Contiguous memory**: Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations
- **Random access**: Any element can be accessed directly using its index
- **Zero-based indexing**: First element is at index 0 (in most languages)

Syntax (C/Java): `datatype arrayName[size]`
Example: `int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

**7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of arrays? (Microsoft, Zoho)**
Answer:
**Advantages:**
- **Random access**: O(1) time complexity for accessing elements
- **Memory efficient**: No extra memory for pointers
- **Cache friendly**: Better cache locality due to contiguous memory
- **Simple implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Mathematical operations**: Easy to perform mathematical operations

**Disadvantages:**
- **Fixed size**: Cannot change size during runtime
- **Memory wastage**: If array is not fully utilized
- **Expensive insertion/deletion**: O(n) time complexity for insertion/deletion
- **Homogeneous**: Can store only one type of data
- **Memory allocation**: Requires contiguous memory block

**8. What is the difference between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays? (Facebook, Google)**
Answer:
**One-Dimensional Array:**
- Linear arrangement of elements
- Uses single index to access elements
- Elements are stored in a single row
- Memory requirement: n * sizeof(datatype)
- Declaration: `datatype arrayName[size]`
- Example: `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Access: `arr[i]`

**Multi-Dimensional Array:**
- Elements arranged in rows and columns (2D) or higher dimensions
- Uses multiple indices to access elements
- Most common is 2D array (matrix)
- Memory requirement: rows * columns * sizeof(datatype)
- Declaration: `datatype arrayName[rows][columns]`
- Example: `int matrix[3][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}}`
- Access: `matrix[i][j]`

**9. What is array indexing and how does it work? (Amazon, Microsoft)**
Answer: Array indexing is the method of accessing individual elements in an array using their position number (index).

**How it works:**
- **Index**: A number that represents the position of an element
- **Zero-based indexing**: Most languages start indexing from 0
- **Formula**: Address of element = Base address + (index * size of datatype)
- **Range**: Valid indices are from 0 to (size-1)

**Example:**
```
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Index:        0   1   2   3   4
```

**Access operations:**
- `arr[0]` returns 10 (first element)
- `arr[2]` returns 30 (third element)
- `arr[4]` returns 50 (last element)

**10. What is the difference between array and ArrayList? (Zoho, Facebook)**
Answer:
**Array:**
- **Fixed size**: Size cannot be changed after declaration
- **Static**: Memory allocated at compile time
- **Primitive and objects**: Can store both primitive types and objects
- **Performance**: Faster access due to direct memory access
- **Memory**: Less memory overhead
- **Syntax**: `int[] arr = new int[5]`
- **Dimension**: Can be multi-dimensional

**ArrayList:**
- **Dynamic size**: Size can be changed during runtime
- **Dynamic**: Memory allocated at runtime
- **Objects only**: Can store only objects (uses wrapper classes for primitives)
- **Performance**: Slightly slower due to method calls
- **Memory**: More memory overhead due to additional features
- **Syntax**: `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>()`
- **Dimension**: Only one-dimensional
- **Methods**: Provides methods like add(), remove(), size(), etc.
- **Type safety**: Supports generics for type safety

**Memory Layout:**
- Array: Contiguous memory allocation
- ArrayList: Uses dynamic array internally with growth factor
