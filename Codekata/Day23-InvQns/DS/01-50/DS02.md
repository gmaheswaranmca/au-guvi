## LINKED LISTS

### 11. What is a linked list? (Google, Amazon)

**Answer:**
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Dynamic size**: Can grow or shrink during runtime
- **Non-contiguous memory**: Elements stored anywhere in memory
- **Sequential access**: Elements accessed sequentially, not randomly
- **Node-based**: Each element is a node containing data and pointer

**Structure:**
```
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> NULL
```

**Basic Node Structure:**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data part
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to next node
}
```

### 12. What are the advantages and disadvantages of linked lists? (Microsoft, Zoho)

**Answer:**

**Advantages:**
- **Dynamic size**: Can grow or shrink at runtime
- **Efficient insertion/deletion**: O(1) time at beginning
- **Memory efficient**: No memory wastage, allocates as needed
- **Flexible**: Easy to implement other data structures (stacks, queues)
- **No memory pre-allocation**: Memory allocated when needed

**Disadvantages:**
- **No random access**: O(n) time to access elements
- **Extra memory**: Additional memory for storing pointers
- **Not cache-friendly**: Non-contiguous memory locations
- **Sequential access only**: Cannot directly access middle elements
- **Pointer overhead**: Extra space for storing addresses
- **No backward traversal**: In singly linked lists

### 13. What is the difference between array and linked list? (Facebook, Google)

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Array | Linked List |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Memory Layout** | Contiguous | Non-contiguous |
| **Size** | Fixed (static) | Dynamic |
| **Access Time** | O(1) - Random access | O(n) - Sequential access |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | O(n) - Shifting required | O(1) - At known position |
| **Memory Overhead** | No extra memory | Extra memory for pointers |
| **Cache Performance** | Better (locality) | Poor (scattered memory) |
| **Memory Allocation** | Compile time | Runtime |
| **Indexing** | Supported | Not supported |

**When to use:**
- **Array**: When frequent random access is needed
- **Linked List**: When frequent insertions/deletions are needed

### 14. What is a node in a linked list? (Amazon, Microsoft)

**Answer:**
A node is the basic building block of a linked list. It's a structure that contains two main components:

**Components of a Node:**
1. **Data Field**: Stores the actual data/value
2. **Pointer Field**: Stores the address of the next node

**Node Structure Examples:**

**C/C++:**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data part
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to next node
};
```

**Java:**
```java
class Node {
    int data;           // Data part
    Node next;          // Reference to next node
}
```

**Python:**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data    # Data part
        self.next = None    # Reference to next node
```

**Types of Nodes:**
- **Singly linked**: One pointer (next)
- **Doubly linked**: Two pointers (next and previous)
- **Circular**: Last node points to first node

### 15. What are the types of linked lists? (Zoho, Facebook)

**Answer:**

**1. Singly Linked List:**
- Each node has one pointer to the next node
- Traversal only in forward direction
- Last node points to NULL

**2. Doubly Linked List:**
- Each node has two pointers (next and previous)
- Traversal in both directions
- First node's previous = NULL, last node's next = NULL

**3. Circular Linked List:**
- Last node points to the first node
- Forms a circle, no NULL pointer at the end
- Can be singly or doubly circular

**4. Doubly Circular Linked List:**
- Combination of doubly and circular
- Each node has two pointers
- Forms a circle in both directions

**Visual Representation:**
```
Singly: A -> B -> C -> NULL
Doubly: NULL <- A <-> B <-> C -> NULL
Circular: A -> B -> C -> A (back to A)
```

### 16. What is a singly linked list? (Google, Amazon)

**Answer:**
A singly linked list is the simplest form of linked list where each node contains data and a single pointer to the next node in the sequence.

**Characteristics:**
- **Unidirectional**: Can only traverse in forward direction
- **Single pointer**: Each node has only one next pointer
- **Linear structure**: Elements arranged in linear order
- **Dynamic size**: Can grow or shrink during runtime

**Structure:**
```
HEAD -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> NULL
```

**Basic Operations:**
- **Insertion**: At beginning, end, or specific position
- **Deletion**: From beginning, end, or specific position
- **Traversal**: Visit each node sequentially
- **Search**: Find a specific element

**Implementation Example (C):**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

// Insert at beginning
void insertAtBeginning(struct Node** head, int newData) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = newData;
    newNode->next = *head;
    *head = newNode;
}
```

### 17. What is a doubly linked list? (Microsoft, Zoho)

**Answer:**
A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains data and two pointers - one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.

**Characteristics:**
- **Bidirectional**: Can traverse in both forward and backward directions
- **Two pointers**: Each node has next and previous pointers
- **More memory**: Requires extra memory for additional pointer
- **Efficient operations**: Easier insertion and deletion at known positions

**Structure:**
```
NULL <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] -> NULL
```

**Node Structure:**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
    struct Node* prev;
};
```

**Advantages over Singly Linked List:**
- **Backward traversal**: Can move in both directions
- **Efficient deletion**: Can delete a node in O(1) if node reference is given
- **Better for certain algorithms**: Like DFS, undo operations

**Disadvantages:**
- **Extra memory**: Additional pointer per node
- **Complex operations**: More complex insertion/deletion code

### 18. What is a circular linked list? (Facebook, Google)

**Answer:**
A circular linked list is a variation of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle instead of ending with NULL.

**Characteristics:**
- **No NULL pointer**: Last node points to first node
- **Circular traversal**: Can traverse indefinitely
- **Two types**: Singly circular and doubly circular
- **Efficient for round-robin**: Perfect for applications like round-robin scheduling

**Structure:**
```
HEAD -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> (points back to HEAD)
```

**Advantages:**
- **Continuous traversal**: Can start from any node and visit all nodes
- **No NULL checks**: No need to check for NULL pointers
- **Efficient for circular operations**: Perfect for round-robin algorithms
- **Memory efficient**: No wasted last pointer

**Applications:**
- **Round-robin scheduling**: CPU scheduling algorithms
- **Circular buffer**: Data streaming applications
- **Music playlist**: Loop through songs continuously
- **Game development**: Circular menus, player turns

**Detection:**
- Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
- Keep track of starting node during traversal

### 19. What is a doubly circular linked list? (Amazon, Microsoft)

**Answer:**
A doubly circular linked list combines the features of both doubly linked list and circular linked list. Each node has two pointers (next and previous), and the list forms a circle.

**Characteristics:**
- **Bidirectional circular**: Can traverse in both directions infinitely
- **Two pointers per node**: Next and previous pointers
- **Circular structure**: First node's previous points to last node, last node's next points to first node
- **No NULL pointers**: All pointers point to valid nodes

**Structure:**
```
  ↱------------------------------------------↴
HEAD <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next]
  ↲------------------------------------------↰
```

**Node Structure:**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
    struct Node* prev;
};
```

**Advantages:**
- **Maximum flexibility**: Can traverse in both directions from any node
- **Efficient operations**: Insertion and deletion at any position
- **No boundary checks**: No need to check for NULL pointers
- **Suitable for complex applications**: Multimedia players, advanced data processing

**Applications:**
- **Advanced music players**: Next/previous with loop functionality
- **Browser history**: Forward/backward navigation with circular buffer
- **Undo/Redo operations**: With circular buffer for memory management
- **Game development**: Complex navigation systems

### 20. How do you insert and delete elements in a linked list? (Zoho, Facebook)

**Answer:**

## Insertion Operations:

**1. Insert at Beginning:**
```c
void insertAtBeginning(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = *head;
    *head = newNode;
}
// Time Complexity: O(1)
```

**2. Insert at End:**
```c
void insertAtEnd(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = newNode;
}
// Time Complexity: O(n)
```

**3. Insert at Specific Position:**
```c
void insertAtPosition(struct Node** head, int data, int position) {
    if (position == 0) {
        insertAtBeginning(head, data);
        return;
    }
    
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && temp != NULL; i++) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    
    if (temp == NULL) return; // Position out of bounds
    
    newNode->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = newNode;
}
// Time Complexity: O(n)
```

## Deletion Operations:

**1. Delete from Beginning:**
```c
void deleteFromBeginning(struct Node** head) {
    if (*head == NULL) return;
    
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    *head = (*head)->next;
    free(temp);
}
// Time Complexity: O(1)
```

**2. Delete from End:**
```c
void deleteFromEnd(struct Node** head) {
    if (*head == NULL) return;
    
    if ((*head)->next == NULL) {
        free(*head);
        *head = NULL;
        return;
    }
    
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    free(temp->next);
    temp->next = NULL;
}
// Time Complexity: O(n)
```

**3. Delete Specific Value:**
```c
void deleteValue(struct Node** head, int value) {
    if (*head == NULL) return;
    
    if ((*head)->data == value) {
        struct Node* temp = *head;
        *head = (*head)->next;
        free(temp);
        return;
    }
    
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    while (temp->next != NULL && temp->next->data != value) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    
    if (temp->next != NULL) {
        struct Node* nodeToDelete = temp->next;
        temp->next = temp->next->next;
        free(nodeToDelete);
    }
}
// Time Complexity: O(n)
```

**Summary of Complexities:**
- **Insert at beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at end**: O(n)
- **Insert at position**: O(n)
- **Delete from beginning**: O(1)
- **Delete from end**: O(n)
- **Delete specific value**: O(n)
