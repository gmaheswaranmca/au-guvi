**Note:** These questions cover fundamental to intermediate OOP concepts in Java. Practice implementing these concepts with actual code examples. Focus on understanding the principles behind each concept rather than just memorizing definitions. Many companies will ask you to write code during interviews, so hands-on practice is essential.
