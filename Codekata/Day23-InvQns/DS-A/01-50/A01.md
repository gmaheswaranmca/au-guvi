# DSA Questions 1-10 - Answers

## 1. What is an algorithm? (Google, Amazon)

**Answer:** An algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It is a step-by-step procedure that takes an input and produces an output after a finite number of steps.

**Key characteristics:**
- Must have a clear starting point and ending point
- Each step must be precisely defined and unambiguous
- Must terminate after a finite number of steps
- Must be effective (each step can be carried out)

**Example:** A recipe for cooking is an algorithm - it has ingredients (input), steps to follow, and produces a dish (output).

## 3. What is the difference between an algorithm and a program? (Facebook, Google)

**Answer:** 

| Algorithm | Program |
|-----------|---------|
| Abstract, language-independent solution | Concrete implementation in a specific language |
| Describes the logic and steps | Executable code that runs on a computer |
| Written in pseudocode or natural language | Written in programming language (C++, Java, Python) |
| Platform independent | Platform and language dependent |
| Focuses on problem-solving approach | Focuses on syntax and implementation details |
| Design phase artifact | Implementation phase artifact |

**Example:**
- **Algorithm**: "Sort array using bubble sort - compare adjacent elements and swap if needed"
- **Program**: Actual C++ code with loops, variables, and syntax implementing bubble sort

## 4. What is algorithmic complexity? (Amazon, Microsoft)

**Answer:** Algorithmic complexity refers to the amount of computational resources (time and space) required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. It helps analyze and compare algorithm performance.

**Types of complexity:**

1. **Time Complexity**: Amount of time an algorithm takes to complete
   - Measured in terms of number of operations
   - Examples: O(n), O(n²), O(log n)

2. **Space Complexity**: Amount of memory an algorithm uses
   - Includes auxiliary space and input space
   - Examples: O(1), O(n), O(n²)

**Importance:**
- Helps choose the most efficient algorithm
- Predicts performance on large datasets
- Essential for scalable system design

## 5. What is Big O notation? (Zoho, Facebook)

**Answer:** Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It represents the worst-case scenario and how the algorithm's performance scales with input size.

**Common Big O complexities:**
- **O(1)**: Constant time - accessing array element
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time - binary search
- **O(n)**: Linear time - linear search
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time - merge sort
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time - bubble sort
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential time - recursive fibonacci

**Example:**
```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // O(1) operation
}
// Overall: O(n)
```

**Key points:**
- Focuses on growth rate, not exact running time
- Ignores constants and lower-order terms
- Describes worst-case scenario

## 6. What is the difference between time complexity and space complexity? (Google, Amazon)

**Answer:**

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Measures execution time | Measures memory usage |
| Number of operations performed | Amount of memory allocated |
| How runtime increases with input size | How memory usage increases with input size |
| Cannot be traded off easily | Can often be traded with time |
| Examples: O(n), O(n²), O(log n) | Examples: O(1), O(n), O(n²) |

**Time Complexity Example:**
```python
# O(n) time complexity
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):  # n iterations
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

**Space Complexity Example:**
```python
# O(n) space complexity
def create_copy(arr):
    new_arr = []  # Additional space of size n
    for item in arr:
        new_arr.append(item)
    return new_arr
```

**Space-Time Tradeoff:**
- Using more memory to achieve faster execution
- Example: Memoization in dynamic programming

## 7. What is best case, worst case, and average case complexity? (Microsoft, Zoho)

**Answer:**

**Best Case Complexity:**
- Minimum time/space required for any input of size n
- Denoted by Ω (Omega) notation
- Example: Quick sort - O(n log n) when pivot is always median

**Worst Case Complexity:**
- Maximum time/space required for any input of size n
- Denoted by O (Big O) notation
- Example: Quick sort - O(n²) when pivot is always smallest/largest

**Average Case Complexity:**
- Expected time/space for random input of size n
- Denoted by Θ (Theta) notation
- Example: Quick sort - O(n log n) on average

**Linear Search Example:**
- **Best case**: O(1) - element found at first position
- **Worst case**: O(n) - element not found or at last position
- **Average case**: O(n/2) ≈ O(n) - element found at middle on average

## 8. What is asymptotic notation? (Facebook, Google)

**Answer:** Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the behavior of algorithms as the input size approaches infinity. It provides a way to classify algorithms based on their growth rates.

**Types of Asymptotic Notations:**

1. **Big O (O)**: Upper bound (worst case)
   - f(n) = O(g(n)) means f(n) ≤ c·g(n) for large n

2. **Big Omega (Ω)**: Lower bound (best case)
   - f(n) = Ω(g(n)) means f(n) ≥ c·g(n) for large n

3. **Big Theta (Θ)**: Tight bound (average case)
   - f(n) = Θ(g(n)) means c₁·g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c₂·g(n) for large n

4. **Little o (o)**: Strict upper bound
   - f(n) = o(g(n)) means f(n) < c·g(n) for large n

5. **Little omega (ω)**: Strict lower bound
   - f(n) = ω(g(n)) means f(n) > c·g(n) for large n

**Purpose:**
- Analyze algorithm efficiency
- Compare algorithms independent of hardware/language
- Focus on scalability rather than exact performance

## 9. What is the difference between O(1), O(log n), O(n), and O(n²)? (Amazon, Microsoft)

**Answer:**

| Complexity | Name | Description | Example | Growth Rate |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| O(1) | Constant | Time doesn't change with input size | Array access, hash table lookup | Flat line |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Time increases logarithmically | Binary search, balanced tree operations | Slow growth |
| O(n) | Linear | Time increases linearly | Linear search, simple loops | Straight line |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Time increases quadratically | Bubble sort, nested loops | Steep curve |

**Performance Comparison for n = 1000:**
- O(1): 1 operation
- O(log n): ~10 operations
- O(n): 1,000 operations
- O(n²): 1,000,000 operations

**Code Examples:**
```python
# O(1) - Constant
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]

# O(log n) - Logarithmic
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# O(n) - Linear
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# O(n²) - Quadratic
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```

**Factors Affecting Efficiency:**
- **Input size**: Larger inputs generally require more resources
- **Input characteristics**: Sorted vs unsorted data
- **Algorithm design**: Choice of data structures and approach
- **Implementation quality**: Code optimization
