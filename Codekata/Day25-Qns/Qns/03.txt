Problem Title:
Jump Game

Problem Description:
You are given an array of non-negative integers nums. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Starting from the first index, determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers representing the array nums.

Output Format:
- Output "YES" if you can reach the last index, otherwise output "NO".

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Sample Input 1:
5
2 3 1 1 4

Sample Output 1:
YES

Explanation 1:
You can jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Sample Input 2:
5
3 2 1 0 4

Sample Output 2:
NO

Explanation 2:
You will always arrive at index 3 with a maximum jump length 0. Therefore, you cannot reach the last index.

Difficulty:
Medium
