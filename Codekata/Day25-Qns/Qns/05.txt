Problem Title:
Largest Number

Problem Description:
Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest possible number when concatenated together. The result should be returned as a string since the largest number may be too large to fit in a standard integer type.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the list.
- The second line contains n non-negative integers separated by spaces.

Output Format:
- A single string representing the largest number that can be formed by concatenating the given integers.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 100
- 0 <= each integer <= 10^9

Sample Input:
4
3 30 34 5

Sample Output:
534330

Explanation:
By arranging the numbers as 5, 34, 3, 30 and concatenating them, we get the largest number 534330.
