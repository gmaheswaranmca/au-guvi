Problem Title:
Interleaving String

Problem Description:
Given three strings s1, s2, and s3, determine whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2. An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings and then concatenated in an order that maintains the left-to-right order of the substrings from each string.

Input Format:
- The first line contains the string s1.
- The second line contains the string s2.
- The third line contains the string s3.

Output Format:
- Print "Yes" if s3 is formed by interleaving s1 and s2, otherwise print "No".

Constraints:
- 1 <= length of s1, s2 <= 100
- 1 <= length of s3 <= 200
- s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input:
aab
axy
aaxaby

Sample Output:
Yes

Explanation:
s3 = "aaxaby" can be formed by interleaving s1 = "aab" and s2 = "axy":
Take 'a' from s1, 'a' from s2, 'x' from s2, 'a' from s1, 'b' from s1, 'y' from s2.
