Problem Title:
Huffman Coding

Problem Description:
Given a set of characters and their corresponding frequencies, construct an optimal prefix code (Huffman code) for the characters. Output the codes assigned to each character.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of unique characters.
- The next N lines each contain a character (a single lowercase letter) and its frequency (a positive integer), separated by a space.

Output Format:
- For each character, output a line containing the character, a colon, and its Huffman code. The output should be sorted in lexicographical order of the characters.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 26
- The frequency of each character is a positive integer not exceeding 10^5.
- All characters are lowercase English letters and are unique.

Sample Input:
4
a 5
b 9
c 12
d 13

Sample Output:
a: 1100
b: 1101
c: 100
d: 101

Explanation:
The Huffman coding algorithm constructs a binary tree based on the frequencies and assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters. The output shows the Huffman code for each character.

Difficulty:
Hard

Test Cases:

b 1
c 1
d 1
e 1
Output:
a: 00
b: 01
c: 100
d: 101
e: 11

Test Case 3:
Input:
2
x 10
y 15
Output:
x: 0
y: 1

Test Case 4:
Input:
4
m 8
n 3
o 6
p 5
Output:
m: 11
n: 00
o: 10
p: 01

Test Case 5:
Input:
1
z 100
Output:
z: 0
