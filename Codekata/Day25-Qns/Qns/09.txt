Problem Title:
Minimum Palindrome Partitioning

Problem Description:
Given a string s, partition s into the minimum number of substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. Return the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string.

Input Format:
- A single line containing the string s.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the minimum number of cuts needed.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input 1:
aab

Sample Output 1:
1

Explanation 1:
The string "aab" can be partitioned as "aa" | "b", where both substrings are palindromes. Only 1 cut is needed.

Sample Input 2:
a

Sample Output 2:
0

Explanation 2:
The string "a" is already a palindrome, so no cuts are needed.

Sample Input 3:
abccbc

Sample Output 3:
2

Explanation 3:
The string can be partitioned as "a" | "bccb" | "c", where all substrings are palindromes.

Difficulty:
Hard

Five Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input: aab
Output: 1

Test Case 2:
Input: a
Output: 0

Test Case 3:
Input: abccbc
Output: 2

Test Case 4:
Input: banana
Output: 1

Test Case 5:
Input: racecar
Output: 0
