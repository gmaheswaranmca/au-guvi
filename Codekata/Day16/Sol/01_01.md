# Tree Diameter using Dynamic Programming on Trees

## Overview

This algorithm finds the **diameter** of a tree - the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. It uses a dynamic programming approach with post-order DFS traversal to efficiently compute the diameter in O(n) time complexity.

## Algorithm Concept

The key insight is that for any node, the longest path passing through it is the sum of the two deepest subtrees rooted at its children. By computing this for every node and taking the maximum, we find the tree's diameter.

## Program
```java
/*
Tree Diameter using DP on Trees (post-order DFS)
We compute for each node the two largest depths among its children.
The diameter is the maximum sum of the two largest depths at any node.
*/

import java.util.*;

public class TreeDiameterDP {
    static List<List<Integer>> tree;
    static int diameter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        tree = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int u = sc.nextInt();
            int v = sc.nextInt();
            tree.get(u).add(v);
            tree.get(v).add(u);
        }
        dfs(1, -1);
        System.out.println(diameter);
    }

    // Returns the depth of the subtree rooted at node
    static int dfs(int node, int parent) {
        int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
        for (int child : tree.get(node)) {
            if (child == parent) continue;
            int d = dfs(child, node) + 1;
            if (d > max1) {
                max2 = max1;
                max1 = d;
            } else if (d > max2) {
                max2 = d;
            }
        }
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, max1 + max2);
        return max1;
    }
}
```

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Class Structure and Variables

```java
public class TreeDiameterDP {
    static List<List<Integer>> tree;  // Adjacency list representation
    static int diameter = 0;          // Global variable to track maximum diameter
}
```

- **`tree`**: Adjacency list where `tree.get(i)` contains all neighbors of node `i`
- **`diameter`**: Global variable that stores the maximum diameter found so far

### 2. Input Processing

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = sc.nextInt();
tree = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
```

- Reads number of nodes `n`
- Initializes adjacency list with `n+1` empty lists (using 1-based indexing)

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u = sc.nextInt();
    int v = sc.nextInt();
    tree.get(u).add(v);
    tree.get(v).add(u);
}
```

- Reads `n-1` edges (a tree with n nodes has exactly n-1 edges)
- For each edge `(u,v)`, adds both directions since the tree is undirected

### 3. Core DFS Algorithm

```java
static int dfs(int node, int parent) {
    int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
    
    for (int child : tree.get(node)) {
        if (child == parent) continue;
        int d = dfs(child, node) + 1;
        
        if (d > max1) {
            max2 = max1;
            max1 = d;
        } else if (d > max2) {
            max2 = d;
        }
    }
    
    diameter = Math.max(diameter, max1 + max2);
    return max1;
}
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Initialize**: `max1` and `max2` track the two deepest subtrees
2. **Iterate children**: For each child of the current node:
   - Skip the parent to avoid cycles
   - Recursively get depth of child's subtree and add 1 for the connecting edge
   - Update `max1` and `max2` if this depth is larger
3. **Update diameter**: The longest path through this node is `max1 + max2`
4. **Return**: The depth of the deepest subtree for the parent's calculation

## Detailed Example

### Input Tree
```
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```

This creates the following tree:
```
    2
    |
    1
    |
    3
   / \
  4   5
```

### Execution Trace

Let's trace the DFS starting from node 1:

#### Step 1: `dfs(1, -1)`
- Children of 1: [2, 3]
- Process child 2: `dfs(2, 1)`

#### Step 2: `dfs(2, 1)`
- Children of 2: [1] (but 1 is parent, skip)
- No children to process
- `max1 = 0, max2 = 0`
- `diameter = max(0, 0 + 0) = 0`
- Return 0

#### Step 3: Back to `dfs(1, -1)` - Process child 2 result
- `d = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `max1 = 1, max2 = 0`

#### Step 4: Process child 3: `dfs(3, 1)`
- Children of 3: [1, 4, 5] (skip 1 as it's parent)
- Process child 4: `dfs(4, 3)`

#### Step 5: `dfs(4, 3)`
- Children of 4: [3] (skip as parent)
- `max1 = 0, max2 = 0`
- `diameter = max(0, 0 + 0) = 0`
- Return 0

#### Step 6: Back to `dfs(3, 1)` - Process child 4 result
- `d = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `max1 = 1, max2 = 0`

#### Step 7: Process child 5: `dfs(5, 3)`
- Children of 5: [3] (skip as parent)
- `max1 = 0, max2 = 0`
- `diameter = max(0, 0 + 0) = 0`
- Return 0

#### Step 8: Back to `dfs(3, 1)` - Process child 5 result
- `d = 0 + 1 = 1`
- Since `d = 1` and `max1 = 1`, we have `d == max1`
- So `max2 = max1 = 1, max1 = 1`
- Wait, let me correct this: `max1 = 1, max2 = 1`
- `diameter = max(0, 1 + 1) = 2`
- Return 1

#### Step 9: Back to `dfs(1, -1)` - Process child 3 result
- `d = 1 + 1 = 2`
- Since `d = 2 > max1 = 1`: `max2 = max1 = 1, max1 = 2`
- `diameter = max(2, 2 + 1) = 3`
- Return 2

### Final Result: Diameter = 3

The longest path is from node 2 to node 4 (or 2 to node 5): `2 → 1 → 3 → 4` with length 3.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Each node is visited exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - For the adjacency list and recursion stack (O(h) where h is tree height)

## Key Insights

1. **Post-order traversal**: We process children before the current node
2. **Two maximum depths**: At each node, we only need the two largest depths among children
3. **Global diameter**: The answer could be the diameter passing through any node
4. **Return value**: Each call returns the maximum depth of its subtree for parent's calculation

## Edge Cases

- **Single node**: Diameter = 0
- **Two nodes**: Diameter = 1
- **Linear tree**: Diameter = n-1
- **Star tree**: Diameter = 2

This algorithm elegantly handles all these cases with the same logic.
