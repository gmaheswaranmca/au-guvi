# Vertex Cover on Trees - Detailed Code Explanation

## Problem Overview
Given an undirected tree with N vertices, find the minimum number of vertices needed to select such that every edge in the tree has at least one of its endpoints selected. This is known as the **Minimum Vertex Cover** problem on trees.

## Complete Code
```java
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    static List<Integer>[] tree;
    static int[][] dp;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        tree = new ArrayList[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int u = sc.nextInt(), v = sc.nextInt();
            tree[u].add(v);
            tree[v].add(u);
        }
        dp = new int[n + 1][2];
        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        System.out.println(dfs(1, 0, -1));
    }

    // state: u = current node, take = 0/1 (not taken/taken), par = parent
    static int dfs(int u, int take, int par) {
        if (dp[u][take] != -1) return dp[u][take];
        int res = 0;
        if (take == 1) {
            res = 1;
            for (int v : tree[u]) {
                if (v != par) {
                    res += Math.min(dfs(v, 0, u), dfs(v, 1, u));
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int v : tree[u]) {
                if (v != par) {
                    res += dfs(v, 1, u);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[u][take] = res;
    }
}
```

## 1. Imports and Class Declaration

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
```

**Purpose:**
- `import java.util.*;` imports all utility classes including `Scanner`, `ArrayList`, `Arrays`, etc.
- `public class Main` declares the main class

---

## 2. Global Variables

```java
static List<Integer>[] tree;
static int[][] dp;
```

**Purpose:**
- `tree`: An array of ArrayLists representing the adjacency list of the tree
  - `tree[i]` contains all neighbors of node `i`
  - Since it's a tree, each connection is bidirectional
- `dp`: 2D memoization table for dynamic programming
  - `dp[u][take]` stores the minimum vertex cover size for subtree rooted at node `u`
  - `take` can be 0 (node `u` not selected) or 1 (node `u` selected)

---

## 3. Main Method - Input Processing

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
```

**Purpose:**
- Creates scanner for input
- Reads number of vertices `n`

### Tree Initialization
```java
tree = new ArrayList[n + 1];
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
```

**Purpose:**
- Creates array of size `n+1` (1-based indexing)
- Initializes each position with an empty ArrayList

### Edge Input Processing
```java
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int u = sc.nextInt(), v = sc.nextInt();
    tree[u].add(v);
    tree[v].add(u);
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Reads `n-1` edges (a tree with `n` nodes has exactly `n-1` edges)
- For each edge (u,v), adds bidirectional connections:
  - Adds `v` to `tree[u]`'s neighbor list
  - Adds `u` to `tree[v]`'s neighbor list

### DP Table Setup and Execution
```java
dp = new int[n + 1][2];
for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, -1);
System.out.println(dfs(1, 0, -1));
```

**Purpose:**
- Creates DP table of size `[n+1][2]`
- Fills with -1 to indicate uncomputed states
- Starts DFS from node 1, with state "not taken" (0), and no parent (-1)
- Prints the result

---

## 4. DFS Function - The Core Algorithm

```java
static int dfs(int u, int take, int par) {
```

**Parameters:**
- `u`: Current node being processed
- `take`: 0 if node `u` is NOT selected, 1 if node `u` IS selected
- `par`: Parent node (to avoid revisiting in tree traversal)

### Memoization Check
```java
if (dp[u][take] != -1) return dp[u][take];
```

**Purpose:**
- If this state has been computed before, return cached result
- Avoids redundant calculations

### Case 1: Node is Selected (take = 1)
```java
if (take == 1) {
    res = 1;  // Count this node
    for (int v : tree[u]) {
        if (v != par) {
            res += Math.min(dfs(v, 0, u), dfs(v, 1, u));
        }
    }
}
```

**Logic:**
- `res = 1`: Count the current node since it's selected
- For each child `v` (excluding parent):
  - We can choose to either select or not select the child
  - Take the minimum of both options: `Math.min(dfs(v, 0, u), dfs(v, 1, u))`
  - Since current node is selected, all edges from current node to children are already covered

### Case 2: Node is NOT Selected (take = 0)
```java
else {
    for (int v : tree[u]) {
        if (v != par) {
            res += dfs(v, 1, u);
        }
    }
}
```

**Logic:**
- Since current node is NOT selected, to cover the edge between current node and each child:
  - **All children MUST be selected** (no choice here)
  - This ensures every edge is covered

### Memoization and Return
```java
return dp[u][take] = res;
```

**Purpose:**
- Store the computed result in DP table
- Return the result

## 5. Algorithm Walkthrough with Example

### Example Tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
      |
      4
```

Edges: (1,2), (1,3), (3,4)

### Step-by-Step Execution of `dfs(1, 0, -1)`:

#### Call: `dfs(1, 0, -1)`
- Node 1 is NOT selected
- Must select all children: nodes 2 and 3
- `res = dfs(2, 1, 1) + dfs(3, 1, 1)`

#### Call: `dfs(2, 1, 1)`
- Node 2 is selected
- Node 2 has no children (except parent 1)
- `res = 1`

#### Call: `dfs(3, 1, 1)`
- Node 3 is selected
- Child is node 4
- `res = 1 + min(dfs(4, 0, 3), dfs(4, 1, 3))`

#### Call: `dfs(4, 0, 3)`
- Node 4 is NOT selected
- Node 4 has no children (except parent 3)
- `res = 0`

#### Call: `dfs(4, 1, 3)`
- Node 4 is selected
- Node 4 has no children (except parent 3)
- `res = 1`

#### Back to `dfs(3, 1, 1)`:
- `res = 1 + min(0, 1) = 1 + 0 = 1`

#### Back to `dfs(1, 0, -1)`:
- `res = 1 + 1 = 2`

**Result: 2** (select nodes 2 and 3)

## 6. Why This Algorithm Works

### Key Insights:
1. **Tree Property**: No cycles, so we can use tree DP
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Solution for a subtree depends on solutions of its child subtrees
3. **Two States**: For each node, we either include it or exclude it
4. **Constraint Enforcement**: 
   - If a node is selected, its children can be either selected or not
   - If a node is not selected, all its children must be selected (to cover edges)

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: Each node is visited at most twice (for both states)
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for recursion stack and DP table

### Edge Coverage Guarantee:
- For every edge (u,v), at least one of u or v is in the vertex cover
- This is enforced by the constraint: if u is not selected, then v must be selected

## 7. Alternative Solutions and Optimizations

### Without Memoization:
The algorithm would still work but with exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems.

### Bottom-up DP:
Could implement iteratively using post-order traversal, but recursive approach is more intuitive for tree DP.

### Greedy Approach:
For trees, a greedy approach exists but is more complex to implement and reason about.

## 8. Test Case Verification

### Test Case: 4 nodes with edges (1,2), (1,3), (3,4)
- **Expected Output**: 2
- **Algorithm Result**: 2 ✓
- **Optimal Set**: {2, 3} or {1, 4}

### Test Case: 3 nodes with edges (1,2), (2,3)
- **Expected Output**: 1  
- **Algorithm Result**: 1 ✓
- **Optimal Set**: {2}

This algorithm efficiently solves the Minimum Vertex Cover problem on trees using dynamic programming with memoization, achieving optimal time complexity while maintaining clear, readable code structure.
