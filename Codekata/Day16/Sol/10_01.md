# Hamiltonian Path with Bitmask DP - Detailed Code Explanation

## Problem Overview
This code solves the **Hamiltonian Path** problem using **Bitmask Dynamic Programming**. A Hamiltonian Path visits every vertex in a graph exactly once. The challenge is to determine if such a path exists in a given undirected graph.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Bitmask Representation
- Uses bits to represent which vertices have been visited
- For N vertices, we need N bits
- Example: For 4 vertices, mask `1011` means vertices 0, 1, and 3 are visited

### 2. Dynamic Programming State
- `dp[mask][u]`: Boolean indicating if it's possible to reach vertex `u` with the set of visited vertices represented by `mask`

## Program
```java
import java.util.*;

public class HamiltonianPathBitmaskDP {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt(), M = sc.nextInt();
        boolean[][] graph = new boolean[N][N];
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int u = sc.nextInt(), v = sc.nextInt();
            graph[u][v] = true;
            graph[v][u] = true;
        }
        // dp[mask][u]: is it possible to reach u with visited mask
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[1 << N][N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) dp[1 << i][i] = true;

        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << N); mask++) {
            for (int u = 0; u < N; u++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << u)) == 0 || !dp[mask][u]) continue;
                for (int v = 0; v < N; v++) {
                    if (graph[u][v] && (mask & (1 << v)) == 0) {
                        dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        boolean found = false;
        int fullMask = (1 << N) - 1;
        for (int u = 0; u < N; u++) {
            if (dp[fullMask][u]) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(found ? "YES" : "NO");
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Code Explanation

### 1. Input Reading and Graph Construction

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int N = sc.nextInt(), M = sc.nextInt();
boolean[][] graph = new boolean[N][N];
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    int u = sc.nextInt(), v = sc.nextInt();
    graph[u][v] = true;
    graph[v][u] = true;
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Read number of vertices `N` and edges `M`
- Create adjacency matrix `graph[N][N]`
- For each edge (u,v), set `graph[u][v] = graph[v][u] = true` (undirected graph)

### 2. DP Array Initialization

```java
boolean[][] dp = new boolean[1 << N][N];
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) dp[1 << i][i] = true;
```

**Purpose:**
- Create DP table with dimensions `[2^N][N]`
- Initialize base cases: `dp[1 << i][i] = true` for all vertices `i`
- This means: "It's possible to reach vertex `i` when only vertex `i` is visited"

**Bitmask Explanation:**
- `1 << i`: Creates a mask with only bit `i` set
- Examples: `1 << 0 = 0001`, `1 << 1 = 0010`, `1 << 2 = 0100`, `1 << 3 = 1000`

### 3. Main DP Transition

```java
for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << N); mask++) {
    for (int u = 0; u < N; u++) {
        if ((mask & (1 << u)) == 0 || !dp[mask][u]) continue;
        for (int v = 0; v < N; v++) {
            if (graph[u][v] && (mask & (1 << v)) == 0) {
                dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Outer Loop:** Iterate through all possible masks from 1 to `2^N - 1`
2. **Middle Loop:** For each vertex `u` in the current mask
3. **Condition Check:** 
   - `(mask & (1 << u)) == 0`: Skip if vertex `u` is not in current mask
   - `!dp[mask][u]`: Skip if it's not possible to reach `u` with current mask
4. **Inner Loop:** For each neighboring vertex `v` of `u`
5. **Transition Condition:**
   - `graph[u][v]`: There must be an edge between `u` and `v`
   - `(mask & (1 << v)) == 0`: Vertex `v` must not be visited yet
6. **State Update:** `dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] = true`
   - Add vertex `v` to the visited set and mark it as reachable

### 4. Final Answer Check

```java
boolean found = false;
int fullMask = (1 << N) - 1;
for (int u = 0; u < N; u++) {
    if (dp[fullMask][u]) {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}
System.out.println(found ? "YES" : "NO");
```

**Purpose:**
- `fullMask = (1 << N) - 1`: All vertices visited (all bits set)
- Check if any vertex `u` can be reached when all vertices are visited
- If yes, a Hamiltonian Path exists

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through **Test Case 1** from the problem:

### Input:
```
4 4
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 0
```

### Graph Structure:
```
  0 ---- 1
  |      |
  |      |
  3 ---- 2
```

This forms a cycle with 4 vertices.

### Step 1: Graph Construction

**Adjacency Matrix:**
```
    0  1  2  3
0 [ F  T  F  T ]
1 [ T  F  T  F ]
2 [ F  T  F  T ]
3 [ T  F  T  F ]
```
Where T = true, F = false

### Step 2: DP Initialization

**Base Cases (N = 4):**
```
dp[0001][0] = true  // mask = 1, only vertex 0 visited
dp[0010][1] = true  // mask = 2, only vertex 1 visited
dp[0100][2] = true  // mask = 4, only vertex 2 visited
dp[1000][3] = true  // mask = 8, only vertex 3 visited
```

### Step 3: DP Transitions (Key Steps)

Let's trace through important transitions:

#### **Mask = 1 (0001) - Only vertex 0 visited**

Current state: `dp[1][0] = true`
- From vertex 0, we can go to:
  - Vertex 1 (edge exists, not visited): `dp[1|2][1] = dp[3][1] = true`
  - Vertex 3 (edge exists, not visited): `dp[1|8][3] = dp[9][3] = true`

#### **Mask = 2 (0010) - Only vertex 1 visited**

Current state: `dp[2][1] = true`
- From vertex 1, we can go to:
  - Vertex 0 (edge exists, not visited): `dp[2|1][0] = dp[3][0] = true`
  - Vertex 2 (edge exists, not visited): `dp[2|4][2] = dp[6][2] = true`

#### **Mask = 3 (0011) - Vertices 0,1 visited**

Current states: `dp[3][0] = true`, `dp[3][1] = true`

From `dp[3][0] = true`:
- Can go to vertex 3: `dp[3|8][3] = dp[11][3] = true`

From `dp[3][1] = true`:
- Can go to vertex 2: `dp[3|4][2] = dp[7][2] = true`

#### **Mask = 7 (0111) - Vertices 0,1,2 visited**

Current states: `dp[7][2] = true`

From `dp[7][2] = true`:
- Can go to vertex 3: `dp[7|8][3] = dp[15][3] = true`

#### **Mask = 15 (1111) - All vertices visited**

Final state: `dp[15][3] = true`

### Step 4: Complete DP Table (Selected Important States)

```
Mask (Binary) | Decimal | Reachable Vertices
0001         |    1    | {0}
0010         |    2    | {1}
0100         |    4    | {2}
1000         |    8    | {3}
0011         |    3    | {0, 1}
0110         |    6    | {1, 2}
1100         |   12    | {2, 3}
1001         |    9    | {0, 3}
0111         |    7    | {2}
1110         |   14    | {3}
1011         |   11    | {3}
1101         |   13    | {0}
1111         |   15    | {3}  ← FULL MASK!
```

### Step 5: Final Check

Check `dp[15][u]` for all vertices u:
- `dp[15][0] = false`
- `dp[15][1] = false`
- `dp[15][2] = false`
- `dp[15][3] = true` ✓

**Result:** Since `dp[15][3] = true`, a Hamiltonian Path exists.

### Reconstructing the Path

One possible Hamiltonian Path: **0 → 1 → 2 → 3**

**Verification:**
1. Start at vertex 0 (mask = 0001)
2. Go to vertex 1 (mask = 0011)
3. Go to vertex 2 (mask = 0111)
4. Go to vertex 3 (mask = 1111)

All vertices visited exactly once! ✓

## Alternative Example: Test Case 5 (NO Solution)

### Input:
```
4 2
0 1
2 3
```

### Graph Structure:
```
0 ---- 1    2 ---- 3
```

Two disconnected components.

### Why No Hamiltonian Path Exists:

The graph has two disconnected components: {0,1} and {2,3}. A Hamiltonian Path must visit all vertices in a single path, but there's no way to travel between the two components.

**DP Analysis:**
- We can reach states like `dp[3][0]`, `dp[3][1]` (visiting vertices 0,1)
- We can reach states like `dp[12][2]`, `dp[12][3]` (visiting vertices 2,3)
- But we can never reach `dp[15][u]` for any vertex `u` because there's no connection between the components

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(N² × 2^N)
- **Outer loop:** 2^N masks
- **Middle loop:** N vertices
- **Inner loop:** N vertices (checking neighbors)
- **Total:** O(N² × 2^N)

### Space Complexity: O(N × 2^N)
- **DP table:** `dp[2^N][N]`
- **Graph:** O(N²) for adjacency matrix
- **Total:** O(N × 2^N)

## Key Insights and Optimizations

### 1. Why Bitmask DP Works
- **State Compression:** Efficiently represents all possible subsets of visited vertices
- **Optimal Substructure:** If we can reach vertex `u` with mask `m`, we can extend to any unvisited neighbor
- **No Overlapping:** Each state is computed exactly once

### 2. Critical Observations
- **Base Case:** Every single vertex is reachable by itself
- **Transition:** Can only move to unvisited neighbors
- **Goal:** Check if any vertex is reachable when all vertices are visited

### 3. Alternative Approaches
- **Backtracking:** O(N!) time complexity (much slower)
- **Held-Karp Algorithm:** Similar DP approach for TSP
- **Graph Properties:** For special graphs (trees, cycles), specialized algorithms exist

### 4. Edge Cases
- **Single Vertex (N=1):** Always has Hamiltonian Path
- **No Edges (N>1):** Never has Hamiltonian Path
- **Complete Graph:** Always has Hamiltonian Path
- **Disconnected Graph:** Never has Hamiltonian Path

## Practical Applications

1. **Route Planning:** Finding paths that visit all locations exactly once
2. **Network Design:** Ensuring connectivity while minimizing redundancy
3. **Scheduling Problems:** Visiting all tasks/states exactly once
4. **DNA Sequencing:** Reconstructing sequences from overlapping fragments
5. **Circuit Design:** Minimizing wire length while connecting all components

This algorithm provides an efficient solution for the Hamiltonian Path problem on small to medium-sized graphs (N ≤ 20), making it practical for many real-world applications.
