Problem Title: Maximum Path Sum in a Tree

Problem Description:
Given a tree where each node contains an integer value, find the maximum sum of values along any path in the tree. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to pass through the root.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
- The second line contains N integers, the values of the nodes (1-indexed).
- The next N-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, denoting an edge between node u and node v.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the maximum path sum in the tree.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- -10^4 ≤ Node value ≤ 10^4

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Sample Output:
11

Explanation:
The path 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 has a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 11, which is the maximum possible path sum in this tree.
