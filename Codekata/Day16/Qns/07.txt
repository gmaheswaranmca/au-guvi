Problem Title: Maximum Independent Set in a Tree

Problem Description:
Given an undirected tree with N nodes, find the size of the largest set of nodes such that no two nodes in the set are directly connected by an edge. This set is called an independent set. You are given the tree as a list of edges.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree (nodes are numbered from 1 to N).
- The next N-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, denoting an edge between node u and node v.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the size of the largest independent set in the tree.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- The given edges form a tree (connected and acyclic).

Sample Input 1:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Sample Output 1:
3

Explanation:
One possible largest independent set is {2, 4, 5}. No two nodes in this set are adjacent.

Difficulty:
Medium
