Problem Title: Count Subsets with Given Sum using Bitmask DP

Problem Description:
Given an array of N positive integers and an integer K, count the number of subsets whose sum is exactly equal to K. You are required to use a bitmask dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and K, where N is the number of elements in the array and K is the target sum.
- The second line contains N space-separated positive integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer: the number of subsets whose sum is exactly K.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ array[i] ≤ 10^6

Sample Input 1:
4 5
1 2 3 4

Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Explanation 1:
The subsets whose sum is 5 are: [1,4] and [2,3].

Sample Input 2:
3 6
2 2 2

Sample Output 2:
1

Sample Explanation 2:
Only one subset [2,2,2] sums to 6.

Sample Input 3:
5 0
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 3:
1

Sample Explanation 3:
Only the empty subset sums to 0.

Sample Input 4:
6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6

Sample Output 4:
4

Sample Explanation 4:
The subsets are [1,6], [2,5], and [3,4].

Sample Input 5:
2 10
5 5

Sample Output 5:
1

Sample Explanation 5:
Only the subset [5,5] sums to 10.
