Problem Title: Tree Diameter

Problem Description:
Given an undirected tree with N nodes (numbered from 1 to N), find the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The length of a path is measured by the number of edges between the two nodes.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers u and v, denoting an edge between node u and node v.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- The given edges form a tree (i.e., the graph is connected and has no cycles).

Sample Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
The longest path is from node 2 to node 4 or node 2 to node 5, passing through nodes 1 and 3. The path length is 3 edges.
