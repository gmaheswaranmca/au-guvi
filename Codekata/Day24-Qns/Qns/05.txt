Problem Title:
K Shortest Paths

Problem Description:
Given a weighted directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find the k shortest paths from a source node s to a destination node t. Each path should be simple (no repeated nodes), and the paths should be listed in order of increasing total weight. If there are fewer than k distinct paths, output all of them.

Input Format:
- The first line contains four integers n, m, k, s, t: the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number k, the source node s, and the destination node t.
- The next m lines each contain three integers u, v, w, representing a directed edge from node u to node v with weight w.

Output Format:
- Output k lines. Each line contains the total weight of one of the k shortest paths from s to t, in increasing order. If there are fewer than k paths, output as many as exist.

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6
- u ≠ v
- The graph may contain cycles, but no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

Sample Input:
5 7 3 1 5
1 2 2
1 3 4
2 3 1
2 4 7
3 4 3
4 5 1
3 5 5

Sample Output:
8
10
12

Explanation:
The three shortest paths from node 1 to node 5 are:
1. 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7)
2. 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 (4 + 3 + 1 = 8)
3. 1 → 3 → 5 (4 + 5 = 9)
But since the output is the total weights in increasing order, the output is:
7
8
9

Difficulty:
Hard
