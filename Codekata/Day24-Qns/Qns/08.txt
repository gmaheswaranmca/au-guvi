Problem Title:
Subtree Size Calculation in a Tree

Problem Description:
Given an undirected tree with N nodes numbered from 1 to N, your task is to compute the size of the subtree rooted at each node. The size of a subtree is defined as the number of nodes in the subtree, including the root node itself.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a single integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers u and v, denoting an undirected edge between nodes u and v.

Output Format:
- Output N integers in a single line, where the i-th integer is the size of the subtree rooted at node i.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- The given edges form a valid tree.

Sample Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Sample Output:
5 1 3 1 1

Explanation:
- Node 1's subtree includes all nodes: [1,2,3,4,5] → size 5
- Node 2's subtree: [2] → size 1
- Node 3's subtree: [3,4,5] → size 3
- Node 4's subtree: [4] → size 1
- Node 5's subtree: [5] → size 1

Difficulty:
Easy
