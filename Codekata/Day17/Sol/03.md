## Algorithm Overview

This program implements **Kahn's Algorithm** for **Topological Sorting** to solve the course scheduling problem. The goal is to find a valid order to take all courses such that all prerequisites are satisfied before taking a course.

## Key Concepts

- **Topological Sort**: Linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u,v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering
- **In-degree**: Number of incoming edges to a vertex (number of prerequisites for a course)
- **Kahn's Algorithm**: Uses BFS approach by repeatedly removing vertices with in-degree 0
- **Cycle Detection**: If we can't process all vertices, there's a cycle (impossible to schedule)

## Step-by-Step Code Explanation

### 1. Input Reading and Initialization
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = sc.nextInt(); // number of courses
int m = sc.nextInt(); // number of prerequisite pairs

List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
int[] indegree = new int[n];
```
- `n`: Total number of courses (vertices)
- `m`: Number of prerequisite relationships (edges)
- `adj`: Adjacency list representing the dependency graph
- `indegree`: Array to store in-degree of each course

### 2. Graph Construction
```java
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a = sc.nextInt();  // course that depends on prerequisite
    int b = sc.nextInt();  // prerequisite course
    adj.get(b).add(a);     // b → a (b must be taken before a)
    indegree[a]++;         // increment in-degree of dependent course
}
```
- **Key Insight**: Edge direction is from prerequisite to dependent course
- If course `b` is prerequisite for course `a`, we add edge `b → a`
- In-degree of `a` increases (one more prerequisite)

### 3. Initialize Queue with Zero In-degree Courses
```java
Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (indegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
}
```
- Courses with no prerequisites can be taken first
- These are starting points for topological sort

### 4. Kahn's Algorithm - Main Processing Loop
```java
List<Integer> order = new ArrayList<>();
while (!q.isEmpty()) {
    int curr = q.poll();           // Take a course with no remaining prerequisites
    order.add(curr);               // Add to the valid ordering
    
    for (int next : adj.get(curr)) { // For all courses depending on current
        indegree[next]--;            // Reduce their prerequisite count
        if (indegree[next] == 0)     // If no more prerequisites
            q.offer(next);           // They can now be taken
    }
}
```
- **Process**: Take courses with no prerequisites, then update dependencies
- **Update**: When a course is completed, reduce in-degree of dependent courses
- **Continue**: Newly available courses (in-degree 0) are added to queue

### 5. Cycle Detection and Result
```java
if (order.size() == n) {
    System.out.println(order);              // Valid schedule found
} else {
    System.out.println(new ArrayList<Integer>()); // Cycle detected - impossible
}
```
- If all courses are processed, we have a valid schedule
- If some courses remain unprocessed, there's a cycle (circular dependency)

## Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through an example with 4 courses and their prerequisites:

### Input
```
4 courses: 0, 1, 2, 3
4 prerequisite pairs:
- Course 1 requires Course 0 (0 → 1)
- Course 2 requires Course 0 (0 → 2)  
- Course 3 requires Course 1 (1 → 3)
- Course 3 requires Course 2 (2 → 3)
```

**Dependency Graph:**
```
    0
   / \
  ↓   ↓
  1   2
   \ /
    ↓
    3
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Initial Setup
```
adj[0] = [1, 2]     // Course 0 enables courses 1 and 2
adj[1] = [3]        // Course 1 enables course 3  
adj[2] = [3]        // Course 2 enables course 3
adj[3] = []         // Course 3 doesn't enable any course

indegree = [0, 1, 1, 2]  // Prerequisites count for each course
```

#### Step 1: Initialize Queue
```
Check in-degrees:
- Course 0: indegree[0] = 0 → Add to queue
- Course 1: indegree[1] = 1 → Wait
- Course 2: indegree[2] = 1 → Wait  
- Course 3: indegree[3] = 2 → Wait

queue = [0]
order = []
```

#### Step 2: Process Course 0
```
curr = 0 (poll from queue)
order = [0]

Process dependencies of course 0:
- Course 1: indegree[1] = 1-1 = 0 → Add to queue
- Course 2: indegree[2] = 1-1 = 0 → Add to queue

queue = [1, 2]
indegree = [0, 0, 0, 2]
```

#### Step 3: Process Course 1
```
curr = 1 (poll from queue)
order = [0, 1]

Process dependencies of course 1:
- Course 3: indegree[3] = 2-1 = 1 → Still has prerequisites

queue = [2]
indegree = [0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#### Step 4: Process Course 2
```
curr = 2 (poll from queue)
order = [0, 1, 2]

Process dependencies of course 2:
- Course 3: indegree[3] = 1-1 = 0 → Add to queue

queue = [3]
indegree = [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

#### Step 5: Process Course 3
```
curr = 3 (poll from queue)
order = [0, 1, 2, 3]

No dependencies for course 3

queue = [] (empty)
```

#### Final Result
```
order.size() = 4 = n
Valid schedule: [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Interpretation
- **Course 0** must be taken first (no prerequisites)
- **Courses 1 and 2** can be taken after course 0 (in any order)
- **Course 3** must be taken last (requires both 1 and 2)

## Example with Cycle (Impossible Schedule)

### Input with Circular Dependency
```
3 courses: 0, 1, 2
3 prerequisite pairs:
- Course 1 requires Course 0 (0 → 1)
- Course 2 requires Course 1 (1 → 2)
- Course 0 requires Course 2 (2 → 0)  // Creates cycle!
```

**Circular Dependency:**
```
0 → 1 → 2 → 0  (cycle)
```

### Execution Result
```
indegree = [1, 1, 1]  // All courses have prerequisites
queue = []            // No course with indegree 0
order = []            // No courses can be processed

Result: [] (empty list - impossible to schedule)
```

## Algorithm Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(V + E)** where V = number of courses, E = number of prerequisites
- Each vertex is processed once
- Each edge is examined once

### Space Complexity
- **O(V + E)** for adjacency list and auxiliary arrays
- **O(V)** for queue and in-degree array

## Key Properties

1. **Correctness**: Produces valid topological ordering if DAG exists
2. **Cycle Detection**: Automatically detects impossible schedules
3. **Efficiency**: Linear time complexity
4. **Flexibility**: Works with any directed graph

## Common Applications

1. **Course Scheduling**: Academic prerequisite planning
2. **Build Systems**: Compilation order for dependencies
3. **Task Scheduling**: Project management with task dependencies
4. **Package Management**: Software installation order
5. **Spreadsheet Calculations**: Formula dependency resolution

## Comparison with DFS-based Topological Sort

| Aspect | Kahn's Algorithm (BFS) | DFS-based |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Approach | Remove vertices with indegree 0 | Post-order DFS traversal |
| Cycle Detection | Natural (count processed vertices) | Requires color coding |
| Implementation | Iterative with queue | Recursive with stack |
| Order | One valid ordering | Reverse post-order |
| Complexity | O(V + E) | O(V + E) |

## Edge Cases

1. **No Prerequisites**: All courses have indegree 0 → Any order is valid
2. **Linear Chain**: A → B → C → D → Sequential order required
3. **Disconnected Graph**: Multiple independent course groups
4. **Self-Loop**: Course requires itself → Impossible schedule
5. **Empty Graph**: No courses → Empty valid schedule

## Practical Considerations

- **Multiple Valid Orders**: Algorithm may produce different valid orderings
- **Priority Handling**: Use priority queue to prefer certain courses
- **Partial Schedules**: Can be modified to handle partial completion
- **Dynamic Updates**: Can handle adding/removing prerequisites
