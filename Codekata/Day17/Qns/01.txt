Problem Title:
Shortest Path in Weighted Directed Graph

Problem Description:
Given a weighted directed graph with N nodes and M edges, and a source node S, find the shortest distance from the source node S to every other node in the graph. If a node is unreachable from the source, output -1 for that node. The graph does not contain negative weight edges.

Input Format:
- The first line contains three integers N, M, and S — the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the source node (1-based indexing).
- The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, w — representing a directed edge from node u to node v with weight w.

Output Format:
- Output N space-separated integers, where the i-th integer is the shortest distance from S to node i (1-based). If a node is unreachable, output -1 for that node.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 2×10^5
- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9
- 1 ≤ S ≤ N

Sample Input:
5 6 1
1 2 2
1 3 4
2 3 1
2 4 7
3 5 3
4 5 1

Sample Output:
0 2 3 9 6

Explanation:
- The shortest path from 1 to 1 is 0.
- The shortest path from 1 to 2 is 2.
- The shortest path from 1 to 3 is 3 (1->2->3).
- The shortest path from 1 to 4 is 9 (1->2->4).
- The shortest path from 1 to 5 is 6 (1->3->5).
