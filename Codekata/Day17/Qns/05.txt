Problem Title:
Single Source Shortest Path with Negative Edges

Problem Description:
Given a directed weighted graph with N vertices and M edges, some of which may have negative weights, find the shortest distance from a given source vertex S to all other vertices using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. If a vertex is unreachable from the source, output "INF" for that vertex. If the graph contains a negative weight cycle that is reachable from the source, output "NEGATIVE CYCLE" and terminate.

Input Format:
- The first line contains three integers N, M, and S — the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the source vertex (0-indexed).
- The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, and w — representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight w.

Output Format:
- If there is a negative weight cycle reachable from the source, output "NEGATIVE CYCLE".
- Otherwise, output N space-separated values, where the i-th value is the shortest distance from S to vertex i, or "INF" if vertex i is unreachable.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 500
- 0 ≤ M ≤ 10,000
- 0 ≤ S < N
- 0 ≤ u, v < N
- -10^9 ≤ w ≤ 10^9
