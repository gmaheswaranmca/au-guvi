Problem Title:
Network Delay Time

Problem Description:
You are given a network of N nodes, labeled from 1 to N. Times of signal transmission between pairs of nodes are given as a list of travel times, where each entry times[i] = (u, v, w) represents that a signal can travel from node u to node v in w units of time. You are also given a starting node K. The signal is sent from node K to all other nodes in the network. Return the time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and M, the number of nodes and the number of edges.
- The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, w, representing a directed edge from u to v with travel time w.
- The last line contains the integer K, the starting node.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal, or -1 if it is impossible.

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 100
- 1 <= M <= 6000
- 1 <= u, v <= N
- 1 <= w <= 100
- K is a valid node label.

Sample Input:
4 4
2 1 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
1 4 4
2

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The signal starts at node 2. It takes 1 unit of time to reach node 1 and node 3. From node 3, it takes another 1 unit to reach node 4. The longest time taken for any node to receive the signal is 2.
