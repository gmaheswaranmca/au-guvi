Problem Title:
Dynamic Median in Subarray

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, you are required to efficiently answer a series of queries. Each query is one of the following:
1. Insert an integer into a specified subarray.
2. Delete an integer from a specified subarray (if it exists).
3. Find the median of a specified subarray.

The median of a subarray is the middle element when the subarray is sorted. If the subarray has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers, n and q, the size of the array and the number of queries.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, the initial array.
- The next q lines each describe a query in one of the following formats:
    - "1 l r x": Insert integer x into the subarray from index l to r (1-based, inclusive).
    - "2 l r x": Delete integer x from the subarray from index l to r (if x exists in the subarray, remove one occurrence).
    - "3 l r": Output the median of the subarray from index l to r.

Output Format:
- For each query of type 3, output the median on a new line. If the median is not an integer, output it as a floating-point number with one decimal place.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ array[i], x ≤ 10^9
- 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n
- It is guaranteed that for each delete operation, x exists in the specified subarray.
- The array may contain duplicate elements.

Sample Input:
8 5
1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6
3 2 5
1 3 6 8
3 3 6
2 1 4 3
3 1 4

Sample Output:
6.0
6.5
4.0

Explanation:
- Query 1: Find median of subarray [3,5,7,9] → sorted: [3,5,7,9], median is (5+7)/2 = 6.0
- Query 2: Insert 8 into subarray [5,7,9,2] (indices 3 to 6) → [5,7,8,9,2], sorted: [2,5,7,8,9], median is 7
- Query 3: Find median of subarray [5,7,8,9,2] → sorted: [2,5,7,8,9], median is 7, but since indices are 3 to 6, subarray is [5,7,8,9], sorted: [5,7,8,9], median is (7+8)/2 = 7.5
- Query 4: Delete 3 from subarray [1,3,5,7] (indices 1 to 4) → [1,5,7], sorted: [1,5,7], median is 5
- Query 5: Find median of subarray [1,5,7] → median is 5
