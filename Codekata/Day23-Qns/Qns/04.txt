Problem Title:
Range Count of Primes

Problem Description:
You are given an array of integers of length N. You need to efficiently answer Q queries of two types:
1. Update the value at a given index in the array.
2. Given a range [L, R], count how many numbers in that range are prime numbers.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and Q, the size of the array and the number of queries.
- The second line contains N integers, the initial elements of the array.
- The next Q lines each describe a query:
    - For an update query: "1 idx val" (set array[idx] = val, 0-based index)
    - For a range query: "2 L R" (count primes in array[L..R], inclusive, 0-based indices)

Output Format:
For each range query, output a single integer on a new line: the count of prime numbers in the specified range.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ array[i], val ≤ 10^6
- 0 ≤ idx, L, R < N
- L ≤ R

Sample Input:
5 5
2 4 5 6 7
2 0 4
1 2 10
2 1 3
1 4 11
2 0 4

Sample Output:
3
1
2

Explanation:
- First query: count primes in [2, 4, 5, 6, 7] → 2, 5, 7 are primes → output 3.
- Second query: update index 2 to 10 → array becomes [2, 4, 10, 6, 7].
- Third query: count primes in [4, 10, 6] → only 5 is replaced by 10 (not prime), so only 1 prime (none in 4, 10, 6).
- Fourth query: update index 4 to 11 → array becomes [2, 4, 10, 6, 11].
- Fifth query: count primes in [2, 4, 10, 6, 11] → 2 and 11 are primes → output 2.
