Problem Title:
Longest Palindromic Prefix

Problem Description:
Given a string S, find the longest prefix of S which is also a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. You are required to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) preprocessing technique to solve this problem efficiently.

Input Format:
- A single line containing the string S.

Output Format:
- A single line containing the longest palindromic prefix of S.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
- S consists of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input 1:
levelracecar

Sample Output 1:
level

Explanation 1:
The longest prefix of "levelracecar" that is a palindrome is "level".

Sample Input 2:
abacdfgdcaba

Sample Output 2:
aba

Explanation 2:
The longest palindromic prefix is "aba".

Sample Input 3:
racecar

Sample Output 3:
racecar

Explanation 3:
The entire string is a palindrome.

Sample Input 4:
abcdef

Sample Output 4:
a

Explanation 4:
The longest palindromic prefix is the first character.

Sample Input 5:
a

Sample Output 5:
a

Explanation 5:
A single character is always a palindrome.

Difficulty:
Medium

Five Test Cases:
1. Input: levelracecar
    Output: level

2. Input: abacdfgdcaba
    Output: aba

3. Input: racecar
    Output: racecar

4. Input: abcdef
    Output: a

5. Input: a
    Output: a
