Problem Title: Overlapping Pattern Occurrences

Problem Description:
Given a text string and a pattern string, find all starting indices where the pattern occurs in the text, including overlapping occurrences. Use the Z Algorithm to efficiently find all such positions.

Input Format:
- The first line contains the text string T.
- The second line contains the pattern string P.

Output Format:
- Print all starting indices (0-based) in T where P occurs, including overlapping occurrences, separated by spaces. If the pattern does not occur, print -1.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ |T| ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ |P| ≤ 10^5
- T and P consist of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input:
ababa
aba

Sample Output:
0 2

Explanation:
The pattern "aba" occurs at index 0 and again at index 2 (overlapping with the previous occurrence).

Difficulty:
Medium

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
aaaaa
aa
Output:
0 1 2 3

Test Case 2:
Input:
abcdef
gh
Output:
-1

Test Case 3:
Input:
abcabcabc
abc
Output:
0 3 6

Test Case 4:
Input:
ababab
aba
Output:
0 2

Test Case 5:
Input:
mississippi
issi
Output:
1 4
