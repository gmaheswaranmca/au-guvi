Problem Title:
Merge K Sorted Lists

Problem Description:
You are given k singly-linked lists, each sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return its head. The merged list should also be sorted in ascending order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer k, the number of linked lists.
- The next k lines each contain a sequence of integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of each linked list. Each sequence is sorted in ascending order.

Output Format:
- Output a single line containing the elements of the merged linked list in ascending order, separated by spaces.

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= 10^4
- 0 <= Number of nodes in each list <= 500
- -10^4 <= Node value <= 10^4
- The total number of nodes across all lists will not exceed 10^5.

Sample Input:
3
1 4 5
1 3 4
2 6

Sample Output:
1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6

Sample Explanation:
There are 3 linked lists:
List 1: 1 -> 4 -> 5
List 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4
List 3: 2 -> 6
After merging, the sorted linked list is: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Difficulty:
Hard
