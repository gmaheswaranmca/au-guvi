Problem Title:
Heap Sort Algorithm

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the heap sort algorithm. Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. Your task is to implement heap sort and return the sorted array.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print the sorted array in ascending order as space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= array[i] <= 10^9

Sample Input 1:
5
4 10 3 5 1

Sample Output 1:
1 3 4 5 10

Explanation 1:
The array [4, 10, 3, 5, 1] is sorted in ascending order using heap sort to get [1, 3, 4, 5, 10].

Sample Input 2:
3
-2 0 7

Sample Output 2:
-2 0 7

Explanation 2:
The array [-2, 0, 7] is already sorted.

Difficulty:
Medium

Five Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
6
12 11 13 5 6 7
Output:
5 6 7 11 12 13

Test Case 2:
Input:
4
9 8 7 6
Output:
6 7 8 9

Test Case 3:
Input:
1
42
Output:
42

Test Case 4:
Input:
7
3 1 4 1 5 9 2
Output:
1 1 2 3 4 5 9

Test Case 5:
Input:
8
-5 0 3 -2 8 7 1 -1
Output:
-5 -2 -1 0 1 3 7 8
