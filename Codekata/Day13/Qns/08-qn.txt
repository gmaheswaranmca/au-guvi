Problem Title:
Top K Frequent Elements

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, return the k most frequent elements. If there are multiple answers, return any of them in any order. You must solve this problem using a priority queue (heap).

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of most frequent elements to return.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print k space-separated integers representing the k most frequent elements in any order.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= n
- -10^9 <= array[i] <= 10^9

Sample Input:
6 2
1 1 1 2 2 3

Sample Output:
1 2

Explanation:
The number 1 appears 3 times, and the number 2 appears 2 times. These are the two most frequent elements.

Difficulty:
Medium

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
6 2
1 1 1 2 2 3
Output:
1 2

Test Case 2:
Input:
8 3
4 4 4 5 5 6 6 7
Output:
4 5 6

Test Case 3:
Input:
5 1
10 10 20 30 40
Output:
10

Test Case 4:
Input:
7 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Output:
Any two numbers (since all have frequency 1)

Test Case 5:
Input:
10 4
2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6
Output:
2 3 4 5
