Problem Title:
Subarray Sum Equals K

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= array[i] <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= k <= 10^9

Sample Input:
5 2
1 1 1 2 1

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:
The subarrays whose sum equals 2 are:
- [1, 1] (from index 0 to 1)
- [1, 1] (from index 1 to 2)
- [2] (from index 3 to 3)
- [1, 1] (from index 2 to 3)

Difficulty:
Medium
