Problem Title:
Intersection of Two Arrays

Problem Description:
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, write a function to return their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in nums1.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing nums1.
- The third line contains an integer m, the number of elements in nums2.
- The fourth line contains m space-separated integers representing nums2.

Output Format:
- A single line containing the unique elements that are present in both arrays, separated by spaces, in any order.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n, m <= 1000
- -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9

Sample Input:
4
1 2 2 1
2
2 2

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The only unique element present in both arrays is 2.
