Problem Title:
Group Anagrams

Problem Description:
Given an array of strings, group the strings that are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Return a list of groups of anagrams.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of strings.
- The next n lines each contain a string.

Output Format:
- Print the groups of anagrams, each group on a separate line. The strings in each group should be space-separated and in any order. The groups themselves can be in any order.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- 0 <= length of each string <= 100
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:
