Problem Title: Longest Consecutive Sequence

Problem Description:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Your algorithm should run in O(n) time.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= array[i] <= 10^9

Sample Input 1:
6
100 4 200 1 3 2

4

Explanation:
The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.

Sample Input 2:
5
9 1 4 7 3

Sample Output 2:
1

Explanation:
No consecutive sequence longer than 1 exists.

Sample Input 3:
8
0 -1 1 2 -2 3 4 5

8

Explanation:
The longest consecutive sequence is [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence".
What is "longest consecutive elements sequence" here.

    The "longest consecutive elements sequence" refers to the largest set of numbers in the array that can be arranged in a sequence where each number is exactly one greater than the previous number, and all numbers in the sequence are present in the array (regardless of their original order). The sequence must consist of consecutive integers, but the numbers do not need to be adjacent in the input array.

    For example, in the array [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4.



Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the sample input and output from your file to clarify the concept of the "longest consecutive elements sequence".

### Sample Input
```
[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** The array is unsorted and contains: 100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2.
- **Step 2:** We look for the largest set of numbers that can be arranged in a sequence where each number is exactly one greater than the previous.

#### Possible Sequences:
- [100] (length 1)
- [200] (length 1)
- [1, 2, 3, 4] (length 4)

#### Why [1, 2, 3, 4]?
- All these numbers are present in the array.
- They can be arranged in order: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Each number is exactly one greater than the previous.
- No other sequence in the array is longer.

### Output
```
4
```
This is the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

---

### Key Points
- The sequence does **not** need to be in order in the input array.
- The numbers in the sequence must be consecutive integers.
- The answer is the **length** of the longest such sequence.

#### More Examples

**Example 1:**  
    Input: `[1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]`  
    Sequences: [1, 2, 3, 4] (length 4), [9, 10] (length 2), [20] (length 1)  
    Output: `4`

**Example 2:**  
    Input: `[8, 20, 7, 30]`  
    Sequences: [7, 8] (length 2), [20] (length 1), [30] (length 1)  
    Output: `2`

Additional Test Cases:

Test Case 6:
    Input:
    7
    5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    Output:
    7

    Explanation:
    All numbers form a single consecutive sequence: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The length is 7.

Test Case 7:
    Input:
    10
    1 2 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8
    Output:
    8

    Explanation:
    Duplicates are ignored for sequence calculation. The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], length 8.

Test Case 8:
    Input:
        5
        100 300 200 400 500
    Output:
        1

    Explanation:
     No two numbers are consecutive. The longest sequence is any single number, so the length is 1.

Test Case 9:
    Input:
        6
        -3 -2 -1 0 1 2
    Output:
        6

    Explanation:
        All numbers form a consecutive sequence: [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2], length 6.

Test Case 10:
    Input:
        1
        42
    Output:
        1

    Explanation:
         Only one element, so the longest consecutive sequence is of length 1.
