Problem Title:
Print All Root-to-Leaf Paths in General Tree

Problem Description:
Given a general tree (a tree where each node can have any number of children), print all possible paths from the root node to every leaf node. Each path should be printed as a sequence of node values from the root to a leaf.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the values of the nodes (node values are unique).
- The next N-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, indicating an edge between node u and node v.

Output Format:
- Print each root-to-leaf path on a separate line. Each path should be a space-separated sequence of node values from root to leaf.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
- Node values are unique integers in the range [1, 10^5]
- The tree is rooted at the first node value given in the second line.

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5

Sample Output:
1 2 4
1 2 5
1 3

Explanation:
There are three root-to-leaf paths:
- 1 → 2 → 4
- 1 → 2 → 5
- 1 → 3

Difficulty:
Medium
