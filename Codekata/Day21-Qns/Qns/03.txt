Problem Title:
Unique Prefixes

Problem Description:
Given a list of words, find the shortest unique prefix for each word. The shortest unique prefix of a word is the smallest prefix which is not shared by any other word in the list. Return the list of shortest unique prefixes in the same order as the input words.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of words.
- The next N lines each contain a word consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output Format:
- Output N lines, each containing the shortest unique prefix for the corresponding word in the input.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
- 1 ≤ Length of each word ≤ 100
- All words consist of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input:
4
dog
cat
car
apple

Sample Output:
d
cat
car
a

Explanation:
- "dog" can be uniquely identified by "d".
- "cat" and "car" share the prefix "ca", so "cat" needs "cat" and "car" needs "car".
- "apple" can be uniquely identified by "a".
