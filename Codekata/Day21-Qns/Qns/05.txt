Problem Title:
Sort Array with Limited Range

Problem Description:
Given an array of N integers where each element is in the range [0, K], sort the array in non-decreasing order. Your solution should be optimized for the given constraints.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and K, the size of the array and the maximum value in the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print the sorted array as N space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 10^4
- 0 ≤ Array[i] ≤ K

Sample Input 1:
6 5
1 4 2 2 5 0

Sample Output 1:
0 1 2 2 4 5

Explanation:
The array elements are within the range [0, 5]. Counting sort is efficient for this range and sorts the array as shown.

Sample Input 2:
5 3
3 1 2 1 0

Sample Output 2:
0 1 1 2 3

Explanation:
All elements are between 0 and 3. The sorted array is printed.

Difficulty:
Easy

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
7 4
4 2 1 3 2 0 1
Output:
0 1 1 2 2 3 4

Test Case 2:
Input:
10 2
2 2 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 0
Output:
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2

Test Case 3:
Input:
1 0
0
Output:
0

Test Case 4:
Input:
8 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Test Case 5:
Input:
4 1
1 0 1 0
Output:
0 0 1 1
