Problem Title:
Remove K Digits

Problem Description:
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible. The result should not contain any leading zeros unless the result is 0.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a string num representing the non-negative integer.
- The second line contains an integer k, the number of digits to remove.

Output Format:
- A string representing the smallest possible number after removing k digits.

Constraints:
- 1 <= num.length <= 10^5
- num consists of only digits and does not contain any leading zeros.
- 0 <= k <= num.length

Sample Input 1:
1432219
3

Sample Output 1:
1219

Explanation 1:
Remove the digits 4, 3, and 2 to get the smallest number 1219.

Sample Input 2:
