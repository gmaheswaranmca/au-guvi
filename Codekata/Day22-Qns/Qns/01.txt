Problem Title:
Sliding Window Median

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers and a window size k, your task is to find the median of each window as it slides from the left end of the array to the right. The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the window size.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print n - k + 1 space-separated numbers, each representing the median of the current window.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= n
- -10^6 <= array[i] <= 10^6

Sample Input:
8 3
1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7

Sample Output:
1  -1  -1  3  5  6

Explanation:
The sliding windows are:
[1 3 -1] -> median is 1
[3 -1 -3] -> median is -1
[-1 -3 5] -> median is -1
[-3 5 3] -> median is 3
[5 3 6] -> median is 5
[3 6 7] -> median is 6

Difficulty:
Hard

Output:
5 4 3 2 1 0 -1

Test Case 4:
Input:
4 4
1 2 3 4
Output:
2.5

Test Case 5:
Input:
10 5
1 3 2 6 7 8 9 4 5 2
Output:
3 6 7 7 8 5
