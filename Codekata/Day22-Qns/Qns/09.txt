Problem Title:
Odd Even Linked List

Problem Description:
Given a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list. The relative order inside both the odd and even groups should remain as in the original list. Note that the first node is considered odd, the second node is even, and so on.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the linked list.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in order.

Output Format:
- Output the values of the reordered linked list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 0 <= n <= 10^4
- -10^6 <= Node value <= 10^6

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
1 3 5 2 4

Explanation:
The nodes at odd indices are 1, 3, 5 and at even indices are 2, 4. After grouping, the list becomes 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4.

Difficulty:
