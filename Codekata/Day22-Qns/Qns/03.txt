Problem Title:
Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the bounds of the histogram. Each bar has a width of 1 unit, and the rectangle must be formed by contiguous bars.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of bars in the histogram.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer represents the height of a bar.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in the histogram.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ height of each bar ≤ 10^4

Sample Input 1:
7
2 1 5 6 2 3 1

Sample Output 1:
10

Explanation 1:
The largest rectangle can be formed using the bars with heights 5 and 6 (indices 2 and 3), giving an area of 5*2=10.

Sample Input 2:
6
2 4 2 1 10 6

Sample Output 2:
10

Explanation 2:
The largest rectangle is formed by the bar with height 10 (index 4), area = 10*1=10.
