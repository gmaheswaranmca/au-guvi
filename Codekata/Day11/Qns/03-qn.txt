Problem Title:
    Factorial Calculation

Problem Description:
    Given a positive integer N, 
    write a recursive function to compute the factorial of N. 
    The factorial of a number N is defined 
    as the product of all positive integers 
    less than or equal to N. 
    By definition, factorial of 0 is 1.

Input Format:
    A single integer N.

Output Format:
    A single integer representing the factorial of N.

Constraints:
    0 ≤ N ≤ 20

Sample Input:
    5

Sample Output:
    120

Explanation:
    5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Difficulty:
    Easy

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
    Input: 0
    Output: 1

Test Case 2:
    Input: 1
    Output: 1

Test Case 3:
    Input: 6
    Output: 720

Test Case 4:
    Input: 10
    Output: 3628800

Test Case 5:
    Input: 20
    Output: 2432902008176640000
