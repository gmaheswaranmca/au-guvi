Problem Title: Tower of Hanoi Solver

Problem Description:
    Given the number of disks N, 
    write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. 

    The objective is to move all the disks 
    from the source rod to the destination rod 
    using an auxiliary rod, following these rules:

    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk 
    from one of the stacks and 
    placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
    3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Input Format:
    - An integer N, representing the number of disks.

Output Format:
    - Print the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
    - Each move should be printed on a new line in the format: 
    "Move disk X from rod A to rod B", 
    where X is the disk number, 
    A is the source rod, and 
    C is the destination rod.
    B is auxiliary rod. 

Constraints:
    - 1 ≤ N ≤ 15

Sample Input:
    3

Sample Output:
    Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
    Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
    Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
    Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
    Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
    Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
    Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

Explanation:
    There are 3 disks on rod A. 
    The goal is to move all disks to rod C using rod B as auxiliary. 
    The output shows the sequence of moves to achieve this.

Difficulty:
    Easy
