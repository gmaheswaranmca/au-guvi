Problem Title: Palindrome Partitioning

Problem Description:
    Given a string s, 
    partition s such that every substring of the partition is 
    a palindrome. 
    
    Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s 
    using recursion and backtracking.

Input Format:
    - A single line containing the string s.

Output Format:
    - Print each possible palindrome partitioning 
      on a separate line.
    - Each partitioning should be represented as 
      a list of strings (substrings), separated by spaces.

Constraints:
    - 1 ≤ length of s ≤ 16
    - s consists of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input:
aab

Sample Output:
a a b
aa b

Explanation:
There are two palindrome partitionings for "aab":
1. ["a", "a", "b"]
2. ["aa", "b"]

Difficulty:
Medium

Five Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
aab
Output:
a a b
aa b

Test Case 2:
Input:
racecar
Output:
r a c e c a r
r a c ec a r
r aceca r
racecar

Test Case 3:
Input:
aaa
Output:
a a a
a aa
aa a
aaa

Test Case 4:
Input:
abc
Output:
a b c

Test Case 5:
Input:
level
Output:
l e v e l
l eve l
level
