Problem Title: Combination Sum

Problem Description:
    Given an array of distinct integers and a target integer, 
    find all unique combinations in the array 
    where the numbers sum to the target. 
    
    Each number in the array may be used 
    an unlimited number of times in the combination. 
    
    The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Input Format:
    - The first line contains two integers N and T, 
    where N is the number of elements in the array and 
    T is the target sum.
    - The second line contains N distinct integers 
    representing the array.

Output Format:
    - Print all unique combinations, 
    one per line. Each combination should be printed as 
    space-separated integers in non-decreasing order.
    - If there are no valid combinations, 
    print "No combination found".

Constraints:
    - 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
    - 1 ≤ array[i] ≤ 100
    - 1 ≤ T ≤ 500

Sample Input:
4 7
2 3 6 7

Sample Output:
2 2 3
7

Explanation:
There are two unique combinations that sum to 7: [2,2,3] and [7].
