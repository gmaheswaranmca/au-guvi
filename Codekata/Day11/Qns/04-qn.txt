Problem Title:
    N-Queens Problem

Problem Description:
    Given an integer N, 
    place N queens on an N×N chessboard 
    so that no two queens threaten each other. 
    
    A queen can attack another queen 
    if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal. 
    
    Your task is to print all possible distinct solutions 
    to the N-Queens problem. 
    Each solution should be represented as a list of strings, 
    where each string represents a row of the chessboard, 
    and 'Q' indicates a queen 
    and '.' indicates an empty space.

Input Format:
- A single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 9), 
  the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to place.

Output Format:
- Print all possible solutions. 
  For each solution, print N lines representing the chessboard configuration. 
  Separate different solutions by a blank line. 
  If there are no solutions, print "No solution".

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 9

Sample Input:
4

Sample Output:

Explanation:
There are two possible ways to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard 
so that no two queens threaten each other. 
Each solution is printed as N lines, 
with 'Q' for a queen and '.' 
for an empty cell. 
Solutions are separated by a blank line.
