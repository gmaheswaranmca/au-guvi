#### **Step 1: Compute LPS Array**
```python
def compute_lps(pattern):
    m = len(pattern)
    lps = [0] * m
    length = 0
    i = 1
    
    while i < m:
        if pattern[i] == pattern[length]:
            length += 1
            lps[i] = length
            i += 1
        else:
            if length != 0:
                length = lps[length - 1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i += 1
    return lps
```

### **Detailed Explanation of `compute_lps` Function:**

#### **Purpose:**
The `compute_lps` function builds the **Longest Proper Prefix which is also Suffix** array for the given pattern. This array is crucial for KMP's efficiency as it tells us how much we can skip when a mismatch occurs.

#### **Variable Meanings:**
- **`m`**: Length of the pattern
- **`lps`**: Array to store LPS values, initialized with zeros
- **`length`**: Length of the current longest proper prefix which is also suffix
- **`i`**: Current position being processed in the pattern (starts from 1)

#### **Algorithm Logic:**
**1. Initialization:**
```python
m = len(pattern)        # Get pattern length
lps = [0] * m          # Initialize LPS array with zeros
length = 0             # No prefix-suffix match initially
i = 1                  # Start from second character (index 1)
```

**2. Main Loop Logic:**
The algorithm uses **two pointers approach**:
- `i`: Moves forward through the pattern
- `length`: Points to the end of current longest prefix-suffix

**Case 1: Characters Match** (`pattern[i] == pattern[length]`)
```python
if pattern[i] == pattern[length]:
    length += 1        # Extend the current prefix-suffix
    lps[i] = length   # Store the length at position i
    i += 1            # Move to next character
```

**Case 2: Characters Don't Match** (`pattern[i] != pattern[length]`)
```python
else:
    if length != 0:
        length = lps[length - 1]  # Use previously computed LPS value
        # Don't increment i, try again with new length
    else:
        lps[i] = 0    # No prefix-suffix possible
        i += 1        # Move to next character
```
#### **Step-by-Step Example:**
Let's trace through pattern `"ABABCAB"`:

```
Pattern: A B A B C A B
Index:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Initial State:**
- `lps = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `length = 0`, `i = 1`

**Step-by-step execution:**

| Step | i | length | pattern[i] | pattern[length] | Comparison | Action | lps | length | i |
|------|---|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|--------|-----|--------|---|
| 1 | 1 | 0 | B | A | B ≠ A | length=0, so lps[1]=0, i++ | [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] | 0 | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | A | A | A = A | length++, lps[2]=length, i++ | [0,0,1,0,0,0,0] | 1 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | B | B | B = B | length++, lps[3]=length, i++ | [0,0,1,2,0,0,0] | 2 | 4 |
| 4 | 4 | 2 | C | A | C ≠ A | length=lps[1]=0 | [0,0,1,2,0,0,0] | 0 | 4 |
| 5 | 4 | 0 | C | A | C ≠ A | length=0, so lps[4]=0, i++ | [0,0,1,2,0,0,0] | 0 | 5 |
| 6 | 5 | 0 | A | A | A = A | length++, lps[5]=length, i++ | [0,0,1,2,0,1,0] | 1 | 6 |
| 7 | 6 | 1 | B | B | B = B | length++, lps[6]=length, i++ | [0,0,1,2,0,1,2] | 2 | 7 |

**Final Result:** `lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`

#### **Key Insights:**
**1. Why `length = lps[length - 1]` when mismatch occurs?**
- When `pattern[i] ≠ pattern[length]`, we can't extend current prefix-suffix
- But there might be a shorter prefix-suffix that we can extend
- `lps[length - 1]` gives us the length of the longest proper prefix-suffix of `pattern[0...length-1]`
- This is the next best candidate to try

**Example:** 
```
Pattern: A B A B C A B
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6

At i=4, length=2:
- pattern[4]='C', pattern[2]='A' → Mismatch
- length = lps[2-1] = lps[1] = 0
- Now try: pattern[4]='C', pattern[0]='A' → Still mismatch
- Since length=0, set lps[4]=0 and move i++
```
**2. Why start `i = 1`?**
- `lps[0]` is always 0 by definition (no proper prefix for single character)
- We start comparing from the second character

**3. The "don't increment i" trick:**
- When we do `length = lps[length - 1]`, we don't increment `i`
- This allows us to try matching `pattern[i]` with the new `pattern[length]`
- We keep trying shorter and shorter prefix-suffixes until we find a match or reach `length = 0`

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
For pattern "ABABCAB" at position i=4:

Current state: A B A B C A B
               0 1 2 3 4 5 6
               ↑     ↑
               length=2  i=4

pattern[4]='C' ≠ pattern[2]='A'

Fallback: length = lps[1] = 0

New state:     A B A B C A B
               ↑         ↑
               length=0  i=4

pattern[4]='C' ≠ pattern[0]='A'
Since length=0, set lps[4]=0 and increment i
```
#### **Time Complexity Analysis:**
- **Each character is processed at most twice**
- When we increment `i`, we process a new character
- When we do `length = lps[length - 1]`, we're essentially "unwinding" previous work
- Total operations ≤ 2m, so **O(m) time complexity**

#### **Why This Works:**
The algorithm efficiently builds the LPS array by:
1. **Extending existing prefix-suffixes** when characters match
2. **Falling back to shorter prefix-suffixes** when characters don't match
3. **Using previously computed information** to avoid redundant work

This preprocessing step is what makes KMP algorithm efficient during the actual search phase.
