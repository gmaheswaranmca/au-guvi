# Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) Algorithm

## Overview
This program implements the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) algorithm, which finds the length of the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix of the same string.

## Algorithm Explanation

### What is LPS?
- **Prefix**: A substring that starts from the beginning of the string
- **Suffix**: A substring that ends at the end of the string
- **Proper Prefix/Suffix**: A prefix/suffix that is not equal to the entire string
- **LPS**: The length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix

### Example
For string `"abcab"`:
- Prefixes: `"a"`, `"ab"`, `"abc"`, `"abca"`
- Suffixes: `"b"`, `"ab"`, `"cab"`, `"bcab"`
- Common: `"ab"` (length 2)
- LPS = 2

## Let's Start with a Simpler Example

Before diving into "ababaca", let's understand with a simpler string: **"abab"**

```
String: a b a b
Index:  0 1 2 3
```

**What we're looking for**: Does any prefix match any suffix?

**All possible prefixes of "abab":**
- "a" (position 0)
- "ab" (positions 0-1)  
- "aba" (positions 0-2)

**All possible suffixes of "abab":**
- "b" (position 3)
- "ab" (positions 2-3)
- "bab" (positions 1-3)

**Common ones:** "ab" appears as both prefix and suffix!
- Prefix "ab" = positions 0-1
- Suffix "ab" = positions 2-3

So the LPS length for "abab" is 2.

**Now let's trace "abab":**

1. i=1: Compare 'b' with 'a' → No match → lps[1]=0
2. i=2: Compare 'a' with 'a' → Match! → len=1, lps[2]=1
3. i=3: Compare 'b' with 'b' → Match! → len=2, lps[3]=2

Result: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2]

**Visual representation:**
```
a b a b
↑   ↑ ↑  
|   └─┘  These match!
└─────── This is the prefix "ab"
```

## Algorithm Steps

### 1. Initialize Variables
```java
int n = s.length();
int[] lps = new int[n];  // LPS array to store values
int len = 0;             // Length of previous longest prefix suffix
int i = 1;               // Start from second character
```

### 2. Build LPS Array
The algorithm uses two pointers:
- `len`: Points to the end of the current matching prefix
- `i`: Current position being processed

### 3. Two Cases
1. **Characters Match** (`s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(len)`):
   - Increment `len`
   - Set `lps[i] = len`
   - Move to next character (`i++`)

2. **Characters Don't Match**:
   - If `len != 0`: Use previously computed LPS value (`len = lps[len - 1]`)
   - If `len == 0`: Set `lps[i] = 0` and move to next character

## Code Walkthrough

```java
while (i < n) {
    if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(len)) {
        // Case 1: Characters match
        len++;
        lps[i] = len;
        i++;
    } else {
        // Case 2: Characters don't match
        if (len != 0) {
            // Try shorter prefix
            len = lps[len - 1];
        } else {
            // No match possible
            lps[i] = 0;
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Example Trace - Step by Step Understanding

For string `"ababaca"` (indices 0,1,2,3,4,5,6):

```
String:  a b a b a c a
Index:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Initial Setup:**
- `lps = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (all zeros initially)
- `len = 0` (length of current matching prefix)
- `i = 1` (we start from index 1, not 0)

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

### Step 1: i=1, char='b'
- **Compare**: s[1]='b' vs s[0]='a' (len=0)
- **Match?** No
- **Action**: Since len=0, set lps[1]=0, move i to 2
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

### Step 2: i=2, char='a'
- **Compare**: s[2]='a' vs s[0]='a' (len=0)
- **Match?** Yes! 
- **Action**: len becomes 1, lps[2]=1, move i to 3
- **Meaning**: "a" at position 0 matches "a" at position 2
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

### Step 3: i=3, char='b'
- **Compare**: s[3]='b' vs s[1]='b' (len=1)
- **Match?** Yes!
- **Action**: len becomes 2, lps[3]=2, move i to 4
- **Meaning**: "ab" (positions 0-1) matches "ab" (positions 2-3)
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]

### Step 4: i=4, char='a'
- **Compare**: s[4]='a' vs s[2]='a' (len=2)
- **Match?** Yes!
- **Action**: len becomes 3, lps[4]=3, move i to 5
- **Meaning**: "aba" (positions 0-2) matches "aba" (positions 2-4)
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0]

### Step 5: i=5, char='c' (This is the tricky part!)
- **Compare**: s[5]='c' vs s[3]='b' (len=3)
- **Match?** No
- **Action**: Since len≠0, try a shorter prefix: len = lps[len-1] = lps[2] = 1
- **Now Compare**: s[5]='c' vs s[1]='b' (len=1)
- **Match?** Still No
- **Action**: len = lps[len-1] = lps[0] = 0
- **Now Compare**: s[5]='c' vs s[0]='a' (len=0)
- **Match?** Still No
- **Action**: Since len=0, set lps[5]=0, move i to 6
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0]

### Step 6: i=6, char='a'
- **Compare**: s[6]='a' vs s[0]='a' (len=0)
- **Match?** Yes!
- **Action**: len becomes 1, lps[6]=1, i becomes 7 (end)
- **Meaning**: "a" at position 0 matches "a" at position 6
- **Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1]

**Final Answer**: The longest prefix that is also a suffix has length 1 (the character "a")

## Table Format for Quick Reference

| Step | i | char | len | s[len] | Match? | Action | lps[i] | lps array |
|------|---|------|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1    | 1 | 'b'  | 0   | 'a'    | No     | lps[1]=0, i++ | 0 | [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] |
| 2    | 2 | 'a'  | 0   | 'a'    | Yes    | len++, lps[2]=1, i++ | 1 | [0,0,1,0,0,0,0] |
| 3    | 3 | 'b'  | 1   | 'b'    | Yes    | len++, lps[3]=2, i++ | 2 | [0,0,1,2,0,0,0] |
| 4    | 4 | 'a'  | 2   | 'a'    | Yes    | len++, lps[4]=3, i++ | 3 | [0,0,1,2,3,0,0] |
| 5a   | 5 | 'c'  | 3   | 'b'    | No     | len=lps[2]=1 | - | [0,0,1,2,3,0,0] |
| 5b   | 5 | 'c'  | 1   | 'b'    | No     | len=lps[0]=0 | - | [0,0,1,2,3,0,0] |
| 5c   | 5 | 'c'  | 0   | 'a'    | No     | lps[5]=0, i++ | 0 | [0,0,1,2,3,0,0] |
| 6    | 6 | 'a'  | 0   | 'a'    | Yes    | len++, lps[6]=1, i++ | 1 | [0,0,1,2,3,0,1] |

**Final Result**: lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1], Answer = 1

**Note**: Step 5 has three sub-steps (5a, 5b, 5c) because we keep trying shorter prefixes until we find a match or len becomes 0.

## Why This Matters - Visual Understanding

```
String: a b a b a c a
Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6
LPS:    0 0 1 2 3 0 1
```

**What each LPS value means:**
- lps[0] = 0: Always 0 (no proper prefix for single character)
- lps[1] = 0: "ab" has no proper prefix that's also a suffix
- lps[2] = 1: "aba" has prefix "a" that's also a suffix
- lps[3] = 2: "abab" has prefix "ab" that's also a suffix
- lps[4] = 3: "ababa" has prefix "aba" that's also a suffix
- lps[5] = 0: "ababac" has no proper prefix that's also a suffix
- lps[6] = 1: "ababaca" has prefix "a" that's also a suffix

## Key Insight: Why We Use lps[len-1] When There's a Mismatch

When we have a mismatch, instead of starting over, we use the LPS value to "jump back" to a position where we might still have a match. This is the genius of the algorithm - it avoids redundant comparisons!

## Applications

1. **String Matching**: Used in KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Finding repeating patterns in strings
3. **Text Processing**: Efficient substring searching
4. **Data Compression**: Identifying redundant patterns

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the LPS array

## Key Insights

1. The algorithm avoids redundant comparisons by using previously computed LPS values
2. When a mismatch occurs, we don't start from the beginning but use the LPS value to skip characters
3. The LPS array itself follows the LPS property - each position stores the length of the longest proper prefix-suffix for the substring ending at that position

## Input/Output

- **Input**: A string from user input
- **Output**: Length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix

Example:
- Input: `"ababaca"`
- Output: `1` (prefix "a" is also a suffix)
