Problem Title: Distinct Substrings

Problem Description:
Given a string S, count the number of distinct substrings present in S. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. You are required to use the Z Algorithm to efficiently solve this problem.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of distinct substrings in the given string S.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
- The sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6

Sample Input:
2
ababa
aaaa

Sample Output:
9
4

Explanation:
Test case 1: The distinct substrings of "ababa" are: "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aba", "bab", "ababa", "bab", "aba". There are 9 in total.
Test case 2: The distinct substrings of "aaaa" are: "a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa". There are 4 in total.
