Pattern Matching with Wildcards

Problem Description:
Given a text string and a pattern string, implement a function to determine if the pattern matches the entire text. The pattern may contain the wildcard characters:
- '?' which matches any single character.
- '*' which matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

You are required to use the Z Algorithm as part of your solution.

Input Format:
The first line contains the text string.
The second line contains the pattern string.

Output Format:
Print "YES" if the pattern matches the entire text, otherwise print "NO".

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of text ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ length of pattern ≤ 10^5
Both text and pattern consist of lowercase English letters, '?', and '*'.

Sample Input 1:
abefcdgiescdfimde
ab*cd?i*de

Sample Output 1:
YES

Explanation:
'*' matches "ef", '?' matches 'g', and the rest matches exactly.

Sample Input 2:
abcde
a*e

Sample Output 2:
YES

Explanation:
'*' matches "bcd".

Sample Input 3:
abcde
a*d

Sample Output 3:
NO

Explanation:
Pattern does not match the entire text.

Sample Input 4:
mississippi
m??*ss*?i*pi

Sample Output 4:
YES

Sample Input 5:
abcdef
*?*?*?*

Sample Output 5:
YES

Difficulty:
Hard
