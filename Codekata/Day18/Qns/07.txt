Problem Title:
Multiple Pattern Search using Rabin-Karp

Problem Description:
Given a list of patterns and a text, your task is to find all patterns that appear in the text using the Rabin-Karp algorithm. For each pattern, output all starting indices (0-based) where the pattern occurs in the text. If a pattern does not occur in the text, output -1 for that pattern.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of patterns.
- The next N lines each contain a pattern string.
- The next line contains the text string.

Output Format:
For each pattern (in the order given), output a line containing the starting indices (space-separated) where the pattern occurs in the text. If the pattern does not occur, output -1.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
- 1 ≤ length of each pattern ≤ 10^4
- 1 ≤ length of text ≤ 10^6
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input:
3
abc
de
a
abcdeabc

Sample Output:
0 5
3
0 5 6

Sample Explanation:
- "abc" occurs at indices 0 and 5.
- "de" occurs at index 3.
- "a" occurs at indices 0, 5, and 6.
