Problem Title:
Minimum Characters for Palindrome

Problem Description:
Given a string S, find the minimum number of characters that need to be added to the front of S to make it a palindrome. You are required to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or its concepts to solve this problem efficiently.

Input Format:
- A single line containing the string S.

Output Format:
- A single integer representing the minimum number of characters to be added to the front of S to make it a palindrome.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^6
- S consists of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input 1:
aacecaaa

Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Explanation 1:
By adding "aa" in front of "aacecaaa", we get "a a a c e c a a a", which is a palindrome.

Sample Input 2:
abcd

Sample Output 2:
3

Sample Explanation 2:
By adding "dcb" in front of "abcd", we get "d c b a b c d", which is a palindrome.
