Problem Title:
Cyclic Pattern Detection

Problem Description:
Given a non-empty string s, determine if it can be constructed by repeating a substring of itself multiple times. You are required to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) preprocessing algorithm to solve this problem efficiently.

Input Format:
- A single line containing the string s.

Output Format:
- Print "YES" if the string can be constructed by repeating a substring, otherwise print "NO".

Constraints:
- 1 <= length of s <= 10^5
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input 1:
ababab

Sample Output 1:
YES

Explanation 1:
The string "ababab" can be constructed by repeating the substring "ab" three times.

Sample Input 2:
abcabcabc

Sample Output 2:
YES

Explanation 2:
The string "abcabcabc" can be constructed by repeating the substring "abc" three times.

Sample Input 3:
abcd

Sample Output 3:
NO

Explanation 3:
The string "abcd" cannot be constructed by repeating any of its substrings.

Difficulty:
Medium

Five Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input: ababab
Output: YES

Test Case 2:
Input: abcabcabc
Output: YES

Test Case 3:
Input: abcd
Output: NO

Test Case 4:
Input: aaaa
Output: YES

Test Case 5:
Input: abac
Output: NO
