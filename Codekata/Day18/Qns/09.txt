Problem Title:
Pattern Occurrences Using Z Algorithm

Problem Description:
Given a string `text` and a string `pattern`, find all starting indices in `text` where `pattern` occurs as a substring. Use the Z Algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences. Return the list of starting indices (0-based).

Input Format:
- The first line contains the string `text`.
- The second line contains the string `pattern`.

Output Format:
- Print the starting indices (space-separated) of all occurrences of `pattern` in `text`. If there are no occurrences, print an empty line.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ length of text ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ length of pattern ≤ 10^5
- Both strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

Sample Input 1:
ababcababcabc
abc

Sample Output 1:
2 7 10

Sample Explanation 1:
The pattern "abc" occurs at indices 2, 7, and 10 in the text.

Sample Input 2:
aaaaa
aa

Sample Output 2:
0 1 2 3

Sample Explanation 2:
The pattern "aa" occurs at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Difficulty:
Medium
