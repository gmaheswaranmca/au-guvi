Problem Title:
DNA Sequence Matching Using Rabin-Karp

Problem Description:
Given a DNA sequence consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and a pattern string of the same character set, find all starting indices in the DNA sequence where the pattern occurs as a substring. Use the Rabin-Karp algorithm for efficient pattern matching.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a string S, the DNA sequence.
- The second line contains a string P, the pattern to search for.

Output Format:
- Print all starting indices (0-based) where the pattern P is found in S, separated by spaces. If the pattern is not found, print -1.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ |P| ≤ 10^5
- S and P consist only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'.

Sample Input:
ACGTACGTGACG
ACG

Sample Output:
0 4 9

Explanation:
The pattern "ACG" appears in the DNA sequence at indices 0, 4, and 9.
