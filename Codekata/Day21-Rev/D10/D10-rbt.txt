Red-Black Tree
    A Red-Black Tree (RBT) is 
    a type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) 
    where each node has an extra bit for color 
    — either red or black. 
    
    The balancing of the tree is not perfect 
    but ensures that the longest path from root to a leaf is 
    no more than twice the length of the shortest path. 
    
    This guarantees that basic operations 
    like insertion, deletion, and search all take O(log n) time.

    ✅ Red-Black Tree Properties (Rules):
        1. Node Color: Every node is either red or black.
        2. Root Property: The root is always black.
        3. Leaf Property: Every leaf (NIL pointer) is considered black.
        4. Red Property: Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes in a row).
        5. Black Height Property: From a node to its descendant leaves, every path contains the same number of black nodes.

    🔑 Red-Black Tree Terminologies:
        | Term                | Description                                                                               |
        | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Root                | The topmost node of the tree, always black.                                               |
        | Leaf (NIL Node)     | Special sentinel nodes that are black and represent the absence of a child.               |
        | Color               | Each node is either red or black. Helps maintain balance.                                 |
        | Black Height        | Number of black nodes on any path from a node to a leaf (not counting the node itself).   |
        | Uncle               | The sibling of a node’s parent. Important in re-balancing during insertions.              |
        | Rotation            | A local tree restructuring operation to maintain BST and balancing properties. Two types: |
        |                     | * Left Rotation * Right Rotation                                                          |
        | Recoloring          | Changing a node's color from red to black or vice versa during fix-up operations.      |
        | Double Red Violation| When a red node has a red parent — violates the Red Property and needs to be fixed.    |

    🔄 Common Operations
        * Insertion: Insert as in BST → color the node red → fix violations via rotations/recoloring.
        * Deletion: Replace as in BST → if black node removed, fix-up needed to maintain properties.

    🔄 Red-Black Tree Operations

        Red-Black Tree (RBT) supports standard Binary Search Tree operations 
        — insertion, deletion, and search 
        — with additional balancing logic to maintain its 5 properties.

        🔍 1. Search Operation
            * Same as in a regular BST: traverse left or right based on key comparison.
            * Time Complexity: `O(log n)` in balanced case.

        ➕ 2. Insertion Operation
            Steps:
                1. Insert node like in a BST.
                2. Color the new node red.
                3. Fix violations using:
            * Recoloring if the uncle is red.
            * Rotations (left/right) if the uncle is black.
            Cases:
                * Case 1: New node is root → color it black.
                * Case 2: Parent is black → tree is valid.
                * Case 3: Parent and uncle are red → recolor.
                * Case 4/5: Parent is red, uncle is black → rotate and recolor.

        ➖ 3. Deletion Operation
            Steps:
                1. Delete node like in BST.
                2. If deleted node is red, no fix needed.
                3. If black, fix-up is required to preserve black-height property.
            Cases:
                * Use a "double black" concept to represent missing black node.
                * Fix using combinations of:
                    * Sibling color checks
                    * Rotations
                    * Recoloring

            Deletion is more complex than insertion due to multiple fix-up scenarios.

        🔁 4. Rotations
            Used during insert/delete fix-up to restore RBT properties.

            * Left Rotation (LR):

            * Performed when a right child becomes the new root of the subtree.
            * Right Rotation (RR):

            * Performed when a left child becomes the new root of the subtree.
            * Left-Right (LR) / Right-Left (RL):

            * Double rotations used in more complex fix-up scenarios.

        ✅ Operation Complexities
            | Operation | Time Complexity |
            | --------- | --------------- |
            | Search    | `O(log n)`      |
            | Insert    | `O(log n)`      |
            | Delete    | `O(log n)`      |

    Example
        A simple Red-Black Tree (RBT) Example 
        to illustrate insertion and balancing:

        ✅ Let's Insert the Following Values in Order:
            `10`, `20`, `30`

        ⚙ Step-by-Step RBT Insertion:
        🔹 Insert 10
            * Tree is empty → insert 10 as root
            * As per RBT rules: Root must be black

            ```
            10(B)
            ```

        🔹 Insert 20
            * 20 > 10 → insert as right child of 10
            * Inserted node is colored red

            ```
               10(B)
                    \
                    20(R)
            ```

            No violation → Parent is black → ✅ Tree is valid.

        #🔹 Insert 30
            * 30 > 20 → insert as right child of 20 (which is red)
            * Now: Red (30) → Red (20) → Violation of RBT Rule 4 (no two reds in a row)

            Fix: Perform Left Rotation at 10 and recolor

        Before rotation:
            ```
               10(B)
                    \
                    20(R)
                        \
                        30(R)
            ```

        After fix (rotate left at 10):
            * 20 becomes new root
            * 10 becomes left child
            * 30 remains right child
            * Recolor 20 → black, 10 and 30 → red
            ```
                 20(B)
                /    \
             10(R)  30(R)
            ```

        Now RBT properties are satisfied ✅

    Example 
        a structured breakdown of 
        all major combinations of insertions and deletions 
        in a Red-Black Tree (RBT), 
        with examples for each case. 
        These demonstrate how violations are resolved using recoloring and rotations.

        🔼 INSERTION CASES
        ✅ Case 1: Inserting the root
        * Insert node → it becomes black (rule: root is black)
            Insert: `10`
            Result:

            ```
            10(B)
            ```

        ✅ Case 2: Parent is black
            * Insert a red child under a black node → no fix needed.

            Insert: `10`, `5`
            Result:

            ```
              10(B)
              /
            5(R)
            ```
        🔁 Case 3: Parent and Uncle are Red
            * Recolor parent and uncle to black; grandparent to red → might recurse upward.

            Insert: `10`, `5`, `15`, `1`
            Result before fix:
            ```
                10(B)
                /    \
             5(R)  15(R)
              /
            1(R)
            ```

            Violation: 5 and 1 are red → 5's sibling 15 is also red
            Fix: Recolor 5, 15 → black; 10 → red
            ```
                10(R)
                /    \
             5(B)  15(B)
              /
            1(R)
            ```

            Now root is red → recolor back to black.

        🔁 Case 4: Left-Right (LR) or Right-Left (RL)
            * Rotate twice (zig-zag shape), then recolor

            Insert: `30`, `10`, `20`

            Before Fix:

            ```
                30(B)
                /
             10(R)
                \
               20(R)
            ```

            Fix:

            * Left rotation on 10 → right rotation on 30
            * 20 becomes new root, recolored to black

            After Fix:

            ```
                20(B)
                /    \
            10(R)  30(R)
            ```

        🔁 Case 5: Left-Left (LL) or Right-Right (RR)
            * Single rotation and recoloring
            Insert: `10`, `5`, `1`
            Before Fix:
            ```
                10(B)
                /
               5(R)
              /
            1(R)
            ```

            Fix: Right rotation on 10

            After Fix:
            ```
                5(B)
               /   \
            1(R)  10(R)
            ```

        🔽 DELETION CASES
            ✅ Case 1: Deleting a red node

            * Just remove it — no violation

            Tree:
                ```
                    10(B)
                   /
                5(R)
                ```

            Delete: `5` → No fix needed
            Result:
                ```
                10(B)
                ```

        🔁 Case 2: Deleting black node with red child
            * Replace and recolor child to black

            Tree:
                ```
                10(B)
                    \
                    20(R)
                ```

            Delete: `10`
            Result:
                ```
                20(B)
                ```

        🔁 Case 3: Double Black – Sibling is Black with Red Child
            Tree:
                ```
                    40(B)
                    /    \

                        /
                    50(R)
                ```

            Delete: `20`

            Fix:
                * Left rotation at 40
                * Recolor

            After Fix:
                ```
                    60(B)
                    /

                    50(R)
                ```

        🔁 Case 4: Sibling is Black with Black Children
            * Recolor sibling red; push double-black upward
            Tree:
                ```
                    40(B)
                    /    \
                20(B)   60(B)
                ```

            Delete: `20`

            Fix:
                * 60 recolored red
                * 40 becomes double black → now root, recolor black

        🔁 Case 5: Sibling is Red
            * Rotate, recolor, then proceed with standard cases

            Tree:
                ```
                    40(B)
                    /    \
                20(B)   60(R)
                ```

            Delete: `20`

            Fix:
                * Rotate left at 40 → 60 becomes new root
                * Then handle deletion as sibling becomes black again

            Result:
                ```

🧩 Use Cases of Red-Black Tree (RBT)
    Red-Black Trees are widely used 
    in systems and libraries 
    where balanced search performance and ordered data are essential. 
    Below are key use cases:
    🔹 1. Self-Balancing Sorted Containers
        RBT ensures that the tree height remains `O(log n)`, 
        making operations efficient even in worst-case scenarios.
        Examples:
            * `TreeSet`, `TreeMap` in Java
            * `std::map`, `std::set` in C++ STL
    🔹 2. Database Indexing
        Used in databases and file systems 
        to maintain indexes 
        where quick lookup, insertion, and deletion are required 
        while maintaining sorted order.
    🔹 3. Memory Management (OS & JVM)
        * Used in Linux kernel to manage memory regions (e.g., Virtual Memory Areas).
        * JVM uses RBT in its internal memory allocators and object tracking.
    🔹 4. Scheduling and Event Simulation
        RBT can efficiently handle time-ordered tasks or events, 
        where insertions, deletions, and 
        finding the next event must be fast.
    🔹 5. Associative Containers in Compilers
        Used in symbol tables to store variables/functions 
        in sorted order and 
        to allow efficient updates.
    🔹 6. Network Routing Tables
        Used in software-defined networking 
        for maintaining ordered routing tables.
    ✅ Why RBT Over Other Trees?
        * Guarantees `O(log n)` time 
            for all operations.
        * Safer choice in applications 
            where worst-case performance must be bounded 
            (unlike AVL trees that may do more rotations).
