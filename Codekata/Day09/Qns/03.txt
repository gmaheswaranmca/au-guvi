Problem Title: Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

Problem Description:
Given a binary tree, print its nodes in level order traversal. In level order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right. Your task is to print all nodes of the tree in this order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- The second line contains N space-separated values representing the nodes of the tree in level order. If a node is null, it is represented by the value -1.

Output Format:
- Print the nodes of the binary tree in level order traversal, separated by spaces.

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 10^4
- Node values are integers in the range [-10^5, 10^5]
- The tree may contain null nodes, represented by -1 in the input.

Sample Input:
7
1 2 3 4 5 -1 6

Sample Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6

Explanation:
The binary tree is:
    1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
Level order traversal visits nodes as: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Difficulty:
Easy

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input:
7
1 2 3 4 5 -1 6
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6

Test Case 2:
Input:
5
10 20 30 -1 40
Output:
10 20 30 40

Test Case 3:
Input:
3
5 -1 7
Output:
5 7

Test Case 4:
Input:
1
100
Output:
100

Test Case 5:
Input:
9
8 3 10 1 6 -1 14 -1 -1 4 7 13
Output:
8 3 10 1 6 14 4 7 13
