Problem Title:
Delete Node in a Binary Search Tree

Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root of the BST after deletion. If the key does not exist in the BST, return the original root. The BST must maintain its properties after deletion.

Input Format:
- The first line contains space-separated integers representing the values of nodes inserted into the BST in order.
- The second line contains a single integer, the key to be deleted.

Output Format:
- Output the in-order traversal of the BST after deletion, as space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 10^4
- -10^5 <= Node value, key <= 10^5
- All node values are unique.

Sample Input:
5 3 6 2 4 7
3

Sample Output:
2 4 5 6 7

Explanation:
The BST is constructed as:
    5
     / \
    3   6
   / \   \
  2   4   7
After deleting node 3, its right child 4 replaces it. The in-order traversal is 2 4 5 6 7.

Difficulty:
Medium
