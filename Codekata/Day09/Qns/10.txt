Problem Title:
Inorder Successor in Binary Search Tree

Problem Description:
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a node in it, find the inorder successor of that node in the BST. The inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the given node's key. If the given node has no inorder successor in the tree, return null.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the BST.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the values of the nodes inserted into the BST in the given order.
- The third line contains an integer K, the value of the node whose inorder successor is to be found.

Output Format:
- Print the value of the inorder successor node. If there is no inorder successor, print "null".

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 10^4
- -10^5 <= Node values <= 10^5
- All node values are unique.
- K is guaranteed to be present in the BST.

Sample Input 1:
7
20 8 22 4 12 10 14
8

Sample Output 1:
10

Explanation:
The inorder traversal of the BST is: 4 8 10 12 14 20 22. The inorder successor of 8 is 10.

Sample Input 2:
7
20 8 22 4 12 10 14
14

Sample Output 2:
20

Explanation:
The inorder successor of 14 is 20.

Sample Input 3:
7
20 8 22 4 12 10 14
22

Sample Output 3:
null

Explanation:
22 is the largest node, so it has no inorder successor.

Sample Input 4:
5
15 10 20 8 12
10

Sample Output 4:
12

Sample Input 5:
6
30 20 40 10 25 35
25

Sample Output 5:
30

Difficulty:
Medium
