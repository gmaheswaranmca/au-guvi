Problem Title:
Find Minimum in BST

Problem Description:
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), write a function to find the node with the minimum value. The minimum value node is the leftmost leaf node in the BST. Return the value of this node.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the BST.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the values to be inserted into the BST in the given order.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the minimum value in the BST.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
- -10^5 ≤ Node Value ≤ 10^5

Sample Input:
7
20 8 22 4 12 10 14

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:
The BST constructed from the input will have 4 as the leftmost node, which is the minimum value.
