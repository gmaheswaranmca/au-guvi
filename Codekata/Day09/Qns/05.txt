Problem Title:
Insert Node in Binary Search Tree

Problem Description:
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a value to insert, write a function to insert the value into the BST. Return the root of the BST after the insertion. The BST must maintain its property: for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value. If the value already exists in the BST, insert it in the right subtree.

Input Format:
- The first line contains a list of integers separated by spaces, representing the initial BST in level order, where 'null' represents a missing node.
- The second line contains an integer, the value to insert.

Output Format:
- Output the level order traversal of the BST after insertion, with 'null' for missing nodes, as a space-separated string.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the BST is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- All values in the BST are unique.
- -10^5 <= value to insert <= 10^5

Sample Input:
4 2 7 1 3
5

Sample Output:
4 2 7 1 3 5

Explanation:
The initial BST is:
    4
     / \
    2   7
   / \
  1   3
After inserting 5, the BST becomes:
    4
     / \
    2   7
   / \  /
  1  3 5

Difficulty:
Easy

Test Cases:
1.

4 2 7 1 3
5
Output:
4 2 7 1 3 5

2.
Input:
40 20 60 10 30 50 70
25
Output:
40 20 60 10 30 50 70 null null 25

3.
Input:
5
3
Output:
5 3

4.
Input:
(empty line)
1
Output:
1

5.
Input:
10 5 15 null null 12 20
13
Output:
10 5 15 null null 12 20 null null null null 13
